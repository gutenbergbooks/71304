PREFACE.</h2>

</div>

<p>If the following Sheets are not
thought so methodically digested,
as some Criticks would require,
yet, it is to be hoped, they
may conduce, in some Measure,
to the reforming of an Opinion,
which, in general, is the Result
of Doctrines, founded by the Ancients
upon the most absurd Principles;
and though (if I may use
the Words of the great Dr <i>Mead</i>)
“<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>I do not promise methodical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv"></a>[iv]</span>
and finished Treatises, but only
some short Hints of Natural
History, and rude Strokes of
Reasoning;” yet I have this
for my Plea, that the Expulsion
of superstitious Mysteries and Errors,
occult Causes, and, in fine,
the Promotion of Truth, in some
Parts of Natural Knowledge, to
the utmost of my Power, are my
sole Intention.</p>

<p>At first I only designed myself
the Honour of laying a few
Thoughts before the <i>Royal Society</i>,
concerning the Nature of such as
are generally called <i>Hermaphrodites</i>;
with a Description of a female
Fœtus that came to my
Hands, which is hereafter mentioned;
but upon communicating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_v"></a>[v]</span>
my Design to some Gentlemen of
Learning, they were of Opinion,
that it was quite necessary to examine
what Authors had said on
that Head; which, indeed, opened
a larger Field than I could have
imagined, and lead me on to swell
this Essay to it’s present Size.</p>

<p>Some, perhaps, may ask what I
have said in this Treatise, that they
did not already know? or may
pretend, they did not believe there
were Hermaphrodites in the World;
to this I answer, that tho’ there
are some who will give their Reason
leave to interfere when a mysterious
Matter comes before them,
yet of those few who may be called
the learned among Men, how
many are there that follow the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
Path of vulgar Errors, rather than
take the Trouble of thinking seriously
about such a Subject? and,
consequently, how few must they
be, that ever had a Notion of
what appears, in the following Introduction,
to have been transacted
concerning Hermaphrodites in all
Ages and Nations, by the wisest
and most learned among them?
so far therefore this Undertaking
cannot be quite useless.</p>

<p>The Quotations through the
whole are genuine and faithful,
taken for the most Part from the
Authors themselves, very few excepted,
which, for want of the
Originals, I was obliged to others
for, who had cited them on different
Occasions, but, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>
were Authors of good Credit;
and which are made <i>English</i> here,
for the Benefit of such Readers as
have not had a due Instruction in
the Languages of the several Authors
from whom they are taken.</p>

<p>As some Words are often repeated
through the whole Essay,
I could not avoid taking the Liberty
of forming the adjective
Word <i>Macroclitorideus</i>; which,
tho’ not in Use before, as I could
find, is highly necessary here for
two Reasons; first, because it is
a short Way of expressing what,
in <i>English</i>, would be a considerable
Sentence; and, secondly, a
much more decent Term, which
I have endeavoured to keep up to
all along, where the <i>English</i> Word<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
might be less agreeable; therefore
since it is calculated for these Ends,
the Freedom of adopting it may
be excusable, if it should amount
to a Crime in any one’s Opinion.</p>

<p>The Introduction sufficiently
points out the Necessity of exhausting
this Subject, in the Conviction
of those erroneous Notions,
propagated from Time to Time,
and so long entertained in the
World; and the best Manner that
occurred to me of proceeding in
it, in Hopes to succeed, was, after
exhibiting such Reasons as
seemed best to deny the Existence
of Hermaphrodites in human Nature,
to bring together the Opinions
of several Authors, and make
comparative Animadversions on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix"></a>[ix]</span>
them; by which Means, I hope,
it will not be doubted, but that
the Truth, which hitherto has
been so clouded and obscured on
this Head, may be said at least to
begin to dawn, and by abler
Hands may hereafter be brought
to a clearer Light.</p>

<p>To judge alone of any Performance
is somewhat less difficult,
than to perform and judge together;
it is therefore that the World
in general are better Judges than
Performers, the Majority of whom
will snarl at a Word or Sentence,
as the Standers-by often do at a
Gamester’s Manner of playing a
Cast, they would have played
themselves another Way, though
perhaps not so well; and, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span>
however imperfect this little
Work may be, as it means only to
search for Truth, I hope the Reader
will be so kind as to make
some Allowance for it’s Imperfection;
for if it should meet with
Censure, that can amount to no
more than a Condemnation of
some particular Thing, in a Work
which in general is, at least, well
intended.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION"><span class="smaller">THE</span><br>
INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p><i>Containing some historical Observations
on Laws, and other Occurrences
concerning Hermaphrodites.</i></p>

</div>

<p>An indolent Person is always the
most credulous of Novelty, at the
same Time that his Supineness hinders
him from examining into the Truth
of any Rumour whatsoever. And this
Kind of Passion is of the meanest Class,
not only as it argues some Contempt or
Neglect of Truth, but also as it is productive
of a very great Evil, in setting a
Limit or Bar to the Progress of Knowledge,
and is therefore a vast Disadvantage
to Society in general; from such a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span>
one as this, not the least publick Good,
no more than private Benefit to himself,
can flow; and the Man who has not a
Desire to cultivate that innate Curiosity,
which is every one’s Property, is unmindful
of one of the greatest Duties incumbent
on him; but when it is duly and
honourably modified, and employed in
the Search of useful Affairs only, it qualifies
him for social Life, and renders
him capable of being of Service in his
Generation.</p>

<p>Though one may be informed of a
Matter which in itself is really Fact, yet
if an Absurdity should arise in the Narration,
it would be laudable to enquire
whether it is to be ascribed to the Relater
or to the Thing told; but as there
is nothing which, when true, can admit
of any Absurdity, there is therefore the
greater Right to be discontented with
what is not easily understood; and it
would even amount to a Crime to neglect
taking Notice of such Accounts,
especially if any Thing monstrous or improbable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii"></a>[xiii]</span>
is blended with them. Shall
we, for Example, sit down with some
Authors, and say, that <i>Hares</i><a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> are always
of both Sexes; that the <i>Rhinoceros</i><a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
is always Male; that the <i>Vulture</i><a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> is always
Female; that of all Animals<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>,
Goats, Sheep, Horses, Men, and Hares,
are most liable to become Hermaphrodites?
and shall we go on to copy or
quote them in a Strain of Approbation?
no; rather let us examine them thoroughly,
lest by assenting to any Part of
them, that does not square with Nature
and Reason, we shall find our Judgments
very deservedly arraigned, and the sagacious
Part of the World much displeased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv"></a>[xiv]</span></p>

<p>The constant Application of some
great Men, (with whom this Island formerly
has been, and is, at present, blessed)
to the Study of Physical Affairs, is
a glorious Example to encourage all
younger Students to imitate their Steps,
in the Pursuit of natural Knowledge,
and, consequently, the publick Good,
according to the different Turns of Mind,
and those Studies that most delight them.
Would such attain to a true Notion of
the Animal Structure? let the Labours
and Example of those great Anatomists
<i>Douglas</i><a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>, <i>Cheselden</i><a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>,
    <i>Nichols</i><a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>, and
<i>Nesbit</i><a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>, be their Guides. Would their
Curiosity expand itself in the general
Field of Natural History? Sir <i>Hans
Sloane</i> shews of this to form inimitable
Scenes. Or would they endeavour to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xv"></a>[xv]</span>
bring Physiological Learning into a clear
Light by Dint of mechanical Reasoning,
the celebrated <i>Mead</i><a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and learned <i>Stuart</i><a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>,
with many others of our most honourable
College, point out the way: would
they, in fine, dive into mathematical
Streams, the certain Directors to Truth,
how many Examples of this Sort, as
well as of those already mentioned, can
our <i>Royal Society</i>, the most famous in
the learned World, produce.</p>

<p>All these are the Stars directing to the
Haven of Science here, whom, if observed
with Attention, it is no wonder
if their Followers emulate to overturn
Errors, and undeceive the Crowd that is
hurried along through Mazes and Labyrinths
of Misrepresentations, to hunt out
the Truth, which is often very intricately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvi"></a>[xvi]</span>
environed round with dark Veils of
Ignorance or Superstition.</p>

<p>Such were the Motives and Considerations
that prompted me to endeavour
to wrest, from the Jaws of Scandal and
Reproach, poor human Nature, which
has, from Time to Time, suffered great
Disgrace, and many of whose innocent
Children have been punished, and even
put to Death, for having been reputed
Hermaphrodites; Ignorance of the Fabrick
of the Body has been the first great
Occasion of those Evils, destroying Evils,
which exist not only amongst the
most ignorant <i>Americans</i>, but also amongst
the Litterati themselves in other
Parts of the World.</p>

<p>What, but Ignorance or Superstition,
could perswade Men to imagine, that
poor human Creatures (which were only
distorted in some particular Part, or had
any thing unusual appearing about them,
from some morbid Cause affecting them,
either in the Uterus, or after their Births)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvii"></a>[xvii]</span>
were Prodigies or Monsters in Nature?
What, but Ignorance and Superstition,
could urge Men to make Laws for their
Destruction or Exclusion from the common
Benefits of Life? in fine, what,
but these very Causes, could make several
harsh Laws continue still in Force against
them in many Places, which suppose
those Women that happen to be
<i>Macroclitorideæ</i>, to be capable of exercising
the Functions of either Sex, with
regard to Generation; and, further, restrain
them under severe Penalties to
stick to that Sex only which they should
choose? as if poor Women could exercise
the Part of any other Sex but their
own.</p>

<p>The <i>Romans</i>, soon after the Foundation
of their City, had Laws made against
their <i>Androgyni</i> remarkably severe; for
whensoever a Child was reputed one of
these, his Sentence was to be shut up in
a Chest alive, and thrown into the Sea<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xviii"></a>[xviii]</span>
which was as often put in Execution as
any of these unfortunate Children were
discovered. The Inhabitants about the
Gulph of <i>Florida</i><a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> hold them also in
great Contempt, believing them to be
something so evil as not to deserve the
Comforts of Life; and though they do
not destroy them yet they deal as badly
by them, for when they go to make
War, as many of these supposed Hermaphrodites
as can be found are obliged to
carry their Provisions; they are also compelled
to bear the Dead, and those sick
of malignant Diseases, to proper Places,
and attend them under very rigorous Circumstances.</p>

<p>Nothing is more certain, than that
the Causes above-mentioned have had no
small Share in the propagating a Belief
among the People of their Existence;
and this appears by a Custom, that long
prevailed amongst the <i>Pagans</i> in <i>Italy</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xix"></a>[xix]</span>
who, upon the Birth of such Children,
as were thought Hermaphrodites, always
consulted their Religious and Wise-Men<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
what to do with them. A remarkable
Instance of this Kind happened in a
Town in <i>Campania</i> in <i>Italy</i>, called <i>Frusino</i>,
where a Child being born of a monstrous
Size, and another at <i>Sinuessa</i>
whose Sex was doubtful, insomuch,
that they could neither judge it Male nor
Female, it was laid before the Magistrates,
who immediately sent for some
of the <i>Aurispices</i>, out of <i>Hetruria</i>, and
they pronounced it, ‘<i>Fædum ac turpe
prodigium</i><a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>,’ whereupon it was thrown
into the Sea according to the aforesaid
Law. But this was not enough, for as
by the Superstition of these Soothsayers
and the <i>Pontifices</i>, such Children were
thought to portend some Evil, there was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xx"></a>[xx]</span>
a Ceremony that always succeeded their
Destruction, which was performed by
twenty-seven Virgins, who marched in
Procession, singing about the City, and
offered Sacrifices to <i>Juno</i>, to avert the
Evil which they imagined was boded by
the Child’s Birth.</p>

<p>This happened many Times afterwards
in <i>Italy</i>; and even the Christian Emperor
<i>Constantine</i>, according to <i>Eusebius</i><a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>,
made Laws against them; for about this
Time the River <i>Nile</i> not flowing so
much over the Lands as usual, the Blame
was laid to their <i>Androgyni</i> who worshipped
and bathed in it amongst the
People; whereupon the Law made against
them was, that they should be
looked upon as a spurious Breed, and
destroyed<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxi"></a>[xxi]</span></p>

<p>‘When the People of <i>Egypt</i>, and
particularly those of <i>Alexandria</i>, worshipped
the River (<i>Nile</i>), a Law was
issued out against certain Men of an
effeminate Nature, who worshipped
among them; whereby all those commonly
accounted Androgyni were to
be destroyed, as an uncertain and spurious
Race, nor was it permitted even
to look on those that had such lascivious
Disorders.’</p>

<p>Some time after the Law was made,
the River began to flow freely, and swelled
again over the Banks, as before.
The Superstition of the Inhabitants was
gratified, who, no doubt, owed the Restoration
of the Waters to the cruel
Law made against those miserable human
Creatures.</p>

<p>In order more clearly to illustrate under
what Restrictions such, as were reputed
Hermaphrodites, lay, touching the
<i>Jewish</i>, as well as the Canon and Civil,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxii"></a>[xxii]</span>
Laws of later Date, I have taken from
<i>Casper Bauhinus</i><a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> as many Tracts as he
has collected, in his own Words as follows;
whereby the Reader will be the
better informed, how much these erroneous
Notions concerning them prevailed
from the beginning.</p>

<h3><i>Of the <span class="antiqua">Jewish</span> Laws concerning Hermaphrodites</i><a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>.</h3>

<p>‘In the <i>Hebrew</i> Law there is often
mention made of Hermaphrodites, although
they were not very sollicitous
about the Causes of their confused Natures.
The Word Androgynus was
very familiar amongst them, which,
they say, signifies one having the Parts
of Generation of both Sexes, one of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxiii"></a>[xxiii]</span>
which, however, they allow to be
more luxuriant than the other. Hence
arise some Disputes amongst them concerning
the Laws they are subject to,
which I have translated from the <i>Talmud</i>
in the following Words.</p>

<p>‘Androgyni are in their Natures to
be esteemed partly as Men, partly as
Women; partly as both Man and Woman;
and partly as neither Man nor
Woman, but as they appear in their
proper Persons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxiv"></a>[xxiv]</span></p>

<p>I. ‘They are like Men in five Respects
according to the Law of the
Book of <i>Moses</i>: 1. By polluting whatsoever
Man or other Thing which
they touch, or that touches them,
whensoever they have emitted their
Semen; as Men pollute every Thing
in such Cases, according to that Law:
2. They are obliged to marry their Brother’s
Widows, not having Children,
as Men are: 3. They are to go dress’d,
from Head to Foot, after the Manner
of Men, and to shave their Heads as
Men, not as Women, for Intemperance
Sake: 4. They are permitted to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxv"></a>[xxv]</span>
marry Women, as other Men do, and
not to marry Men: 5. They are
obliged to observe all the Precepts of
the Law of <i>Moses</i>, as <i>Jewish</i> Men are,
but not as Women, who are not subject
to all, because of those Things
which their different Seasons require.’</p>

<p>II. ‘They are further likened to Women
in seven Respects according to
the Law of <i>Moses</i>: 1. By polluting
every Man, and all Things they shall
touch or are touched by, in the Time
of their Menses: 2. Because it is not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxvi"></a>[xxvi]</span>
lawful for them to converse with Men
alone in any private Place: 3. Because
they may shave their Heads in a circular
Manner as Women; and, besides,
may spread out their Beards,
which the Law of <i>Moses</i> forbids to
Men: 4. Because they are permitted
to walk among the Dead as Women,
which is forbidden to Men: 5. Because
they cannot bear witness, as Women
cannot: 6. Because, as Women, they
are forbidden all unlawful Copulation:
7. Because, as Women, it is unlawful
for them to marry a Priest of the Seed
of <i>Aaron</i>, whereby they are vitiated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxvii"></a>[xxvii]</span></p>

<p>III. ‘They are to be esteemed as
Men and Women in six Respects:
1. If they are assaulted by any Person,
the Matter is to be agreed on according
to the utmost of the Damage:
2. If they are inadvertently killed by
any, the Person is to retire into one
of the privileged Places, ordered for
Security in such Cases, there to remain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxviii"></a>[xxviii]</span>
until the Death of the High-Priest, as
if he had killed a Man or Woman,
according to the Law of <i>Moses</i>; but if
wilfully murdered, the Murderer ought
to die as for murdering a Man or
Woman: 3. When a Woman brings
forth an Androgynus, she ought to be
accounted unclean seven Days, as for
a Male Child; again, other seven Days
for a Female Child, that is, the Days
of Uncleanness and Purification ought
to be numbered as for the bringing
forth of a Son and Daughter, according
to the Law of <i>Moses</i>: 4. An Androgynus,
if of a sacerdotal Race, is a
Partaker of Sacrifices like other Men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxix"></a>[xxix]</span>
that are so, according to the Law of
<i>Moses</i>: 5. They have share of both paternal
and maternal Inheritances, and
also in such other Inheritances as they
may claim by Law as a Man and Woman:
6. When any Androgyni have a
Desire to forsake worldly Affairs, it
ought to be well attested, and they
become <i>Nazarites</i> by their Vow.</p>

<p>IV. ‘They are finally, in three other
Respects, to be treated as neither Men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxx"></a>[xxx]</span>
nor Women, but as a Person proper to
itself, having a Right to neither Sex
in particular: 1. Though an Androgynus
should strike or calumniate another,
he is not obliged to make any
Satisfaction according to the Law of
<i>Moses</i> that regards Men or Women,
but as a singular Person ought to make
Reparation according to the Sentence
and Agreement of proper Judges; 2. If
any Androgyni shall declare their Vows
to the Lord, according to the Estimation
of their Persons, and shall dedicate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxi"></a>[xxxi]</span>
such Estimation or Value to the
Temple of God, if it is not made according
to <i>Moses</i>’s express Law as of
Men and Women, let it be done according
to the Judgment of a Priest,
regarding their particular Persons, or as
it can be best agreed on by such as
preside in the Temple of God: 3. But
if any should declare of themselves
their Desire of being devoted to God,
separated from worldly Things, or
bind themselves by the Vow of a <i>Nazarite</i>,
then if such Persons are neither
Man nor Woman, their own Words
shall be of no effect, nor ought they
to be devoted to God; these are from
the Talmud of the <i>Jews</i>.</p>

<p>‘The Rabbi <i>Meir</i> says, an Androgynus
is a Creature of a particular Kind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxii"></a>[xxxii]</span>
in itself; nor were some wise Men willing
to determine whether they are
Men or Women; but <i>Obthurata</i>’s Opinion
is otherwise, who says they are
sometimes Men, sometimes Women,
according as the Appearance is of the
Parts of either Sex.’</p>

<h3><i>Of the Canon and Civil Laws concerning
Hermaphrodites</i><a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>.</h3>

<p>‘Having recounted some Laws and
Privileges of the <i>Jews</i> concerning Hermaphrodites,
we are now to propose
certain Questions, taken from the Canon
and Civil Laws, referring those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxiii"></a>[xxxiii]</span>
who would know more, to the Writings
of the Authors from whom we have
gathered them, <i>&amp;c.</i>’</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> I. ‘Whether a Man’s or Woman’s
Name should be given to an
Hermaphrodite at it’s Baptism? <i>Ans.</i>
If there seems to be more of a Male
Nature than the other, a Man’s Name;
otherwise, that of a Female; but if it
be doubtful, it lies at the Discretion of
him who gives the Name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxiv"></a>[xxxiv]</span></p>

<p><i>Q.</i> II. ‘How often should an Hermaphrodite
confess? <i>Ans.</i> Once a Year
as a Man or Woman.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> III. ‘Can an Hermaphrodite
contract Marriage? <i>Ans.</i> It is granted
according to the Predominancy of Sex,
which ought to be regarded; but if
the Sexes seem equal, the Choice is
left to the Hermaphrodite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxv"></a>[xxxv]</span></p>

<p><i>Q.</i> IV. ‘Are Hermaphrodites comprehended
in the Statutes requiring
Consent of Friends upon contracting
with Women? <i>Ans.</i> The Statute concerns
not a mixed Person.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxvi"></a>[xxxvi]</span></p>

<p><i>Q.</i> V. ‘Can an Hermaphrodite be
a Witness? <i>Ans.</i> No; except in Cases
wherein a Woman may.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> VI. ‘Can an Hermaphrodite be
a Witness to a Testament or Last
Will? <i>Ans.</i> The predominating Sex
will shew that, <i>viz.</i> if more potent in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxvii"></a>[xxxvii]</span>
the Male Sex he may; if the Sexes
are equal, or more Female, not, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p><i>Q.</i> VII. ‘Whether an Hermaphrodite
ought to stand in Judgment as a
Man or Woman? <i>Ans.</i> An Oath should
first be taken which Member is predominant,
and the Person admitted
accordingly; but if both are equally
powerful, not to be admitted, according
to the holy Church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxviii"></a>[xxxviii]</span></p>

<p><i>Q.</i> VIII. ‘Can an Hermaphrodite
be promoted to holy Orders? <i>Ans.</i> An
Hermaphrodite is driven from this Promotion
because of Deformity or Monstrosity;
but if more masculine than
feminine, the Character may be conferred,
though not Ordination, nor a
Power of Administration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxix"></a>[xxxix]</span></p>

<p><i>Q.</i> IX. ‘Can an Hermaphrodite be
Rector of a University? <i>Ans.</i> No; for there
cannot be a married Clergyman, nor
an Hermaphrodite, nor one less than
twenty Years of Age.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> X. ‘Can an Hermaphrodite be
a Judge? <i>Ans.</i> An Hermaphrodite is
reckoned among the Infamous, to
whom the Gates of Dignity ought not
to be open.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xl"></a>[xl]</span></p>

<p><i>Q.</i> XI. ‘Can an Hermaphrodite be
an Advocate? <i>Ans.</i> No, being infamous.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> XII. ‘Can an Hermaphrodite
be an Arbitrator? <i>Ans.</i> Yes, whether
there appears more of the Male, or
more of the Female Sex, or an Equality
of both, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xli"></a>[xli]</span></p>

<p><i>Q.</i> XIII. ‘Can an Hermaphrodite
fall under Penalties? <i>Ans.</i> If the Male
Sex is predominant, he comes in as a
Male. Another Author says, Male or
Female Sex predominating, when occupying
the Possession of another by
Force, they are under the Law. Another:
There is no need of disputing
the Sex in this Case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlii"></a>[xlii]</span></p>

<p><i>Q.</i> XIV. ‘Can Hermaphrodites pretend
to be ignorant of their Constitutions?</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> XV. ‘Can Hermaphrodites succeed
in Copyholds? <i>Ans.</i> In the Affirmative,
if more Male than Female.
Others: though that Sex does not predominate
by the Appearance of the
Pudenda, yet if they seem, in other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xliii"></a>[xliii]</span>
Works of Manhood, as Agility of Body,
to be equal to Men, they may succeed
in such Inheritance; for that they who
resemble perfect Persons ought not to
be accounted altogether imperfect, because
that Imperfection is concealed,
but Perfection is evident and manifest,
therefore to be chosen. Others: that
the Laws granting Feudes to the descending
Males, do not include Hermaphrodites.
Another: If, from Custom,
Women cannot succeed in a Feude
or Copyhold, so an Hermaphrodite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xliv"></a>[xliv]</span>
cannot; which is to be understood of
those only in whom the female Sex is
most apparent; where such Hermaphrodites,
who are more Female, are
compared to Females, and those more
masculine to Men, therefore the Law
is to be determined accordingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlv"></a>[xlv]</span></p>

<p><i>Q.</i> XVI. ‘How should an Hermaphrodite
serve in any Office? <i>Ans.</i> In
whatsoever Manner they best can themselves,
and not by a Substitute, <i>&amp;c.</i>’</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> XVII. ‘Can Hermaphrodites
chuse, on their Parts, any one of their
Brothers to succeed them? <i>Ans.</i> They
may gratis, but not for Gratification,
<i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlvi"></a>[xlvi]</span></p>

<p>‘Whosoever would know more of
the Laws concerning Hermaphrodites,
may consult the Doctors and Expounders
of the Law; these being sufficient
concerning them.’</p>

<p>We have not even in our own Kingdom
been free from the same prejudiced
Care, in providing Laws against them;
for as we had borrowed many from other
Nations, and added them to our own,
so we find one among them concerning
Hermaphrodites, mentioned by <i>Coke</i><a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
in his Commentary upon <i>Littleton</i>, where
he speaks of them thus<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlvii"></a>[xlvii]</span></p>

<p>‘Every Heir is either a Male, or Female,
or an Hermaphrodite, that is,
both Male and Female. And an Hermaphrodite,
which is also called an
Androgynus, shall be Heir, either as
Male or Female, according to that
Kind of the Sex which doth prevail,
and accordingly ought to be baptized.’</p>

<p>Would not any one imagine that
these supposed Androgyni, instead of being
of the same Nature with us, (however
morbid or deformed their Parts of
Generation might be) were rather another
Race of Animals <i>sui generis</i>, than
what they really are? when a String of
Laws, compiled with so much Accuracy,
and in such a formal Manner, concerning
them, has been exhibited and
increased in all Ages; and is it not Matter
of great surprize, to think that none
had ever undertaken to convince the
World of the Superstition and Vanity of
such Laws? since those that were already
in force, in all Nations, were as sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlviii"></a>[xlviii]</span>
to bind a morbid Subject in all
Cases, as a sound one; which alone is
the Question here.</p>

<p>Though the World was lead on to
credit and countenance those Whims till
<i>Cicero</i>’s Time, and supposing none were
found able or willing to set People right
in this Opinion before him; yet we
may, with great Assurance, ask, why
the Learned since him should neglect
the Hint given by that wise Man in his
Book <i>De Divinatione</i>, where we find
him making a Banter of several Superstitions
then in Vogue with the <i>Romans</i>;
among which he does not forget to enumerate
the <i>Androgyni</i><a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>. ‘<i>Quid cum
Cumis Apollo sudavit, capuæ victoria?
Quid ortus Androgyni? nonne fatale
quoddam Monstrum fuit?</i>’ Sure this,
as well as any other Matter, worth the
Notice of that noble Author, ought well
to bespeak the Attention and Consideration
of the whole World after him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlix"></a>[xlix]</span></p>

<p>Several <i>Jewish</i> Rabbins, and most
of the <i>Hebrews</i> before them, were of Opinion,
that <i>Adam</i> was first made an
<i>Androgynus</i><a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>, on the fore Part a Male,
and behind a Female; that these were
afterwards separated, and the female Part
called <i>Eve</i>. This was their Manner of
explaining those Passages of the Old Testament,
‘Male and Female created he
them;’ and again, ‘Thou hast formed
me behind and before:’ These Opinions
gave Birth to many others afterwards,
as well among the Pagan Philosophers,
as among many Christian Divines;
some of whom, in the Time of
Pope <i>Innocent</i> the Third were so far
Followers of the Rabbins, that they
thought the Sexes in <i>Adam</i> would never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_l"></a>[l]</span>
have been divided if he had not sinned;
which was granting that <i>Adam</i> was created
an Hermaphrodite, and that the two
Sexes were taken asunder afterwards.
Others<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> of these believed so firmly that
Hermaphrodites existed, that they took
Pains to confute the above Opinion, only
fearing lest such should assume to
themselves to have been the first human
Creatures made, from the Words above-mentioned,
‘God created Man Male
and Female, <i>&amp;c.</i>’ and consequently
the most worthy.</p>

<p>From all these Things we see how
little it is to be wondered at, that the
Majority of the World should be thus
riveted in their Notions of Hermaphrodites,
since it appears, that Doctors of the
<i>Jewish</i>, <i>Pagan</i>, and Christian Churches
have been Promoters of them from Time
to Time, by Doubts and Sentiments in
themselves so trivial, as not to deserve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_li"></a>[li]</span>
any Credit from an impartial and judicious
Reader.</p>

<p>Credulities of this Nature, though upon
the most insignificant and ill-grounded
Assertions, generally make great Progress
in the Minds of Men and are
sometimes so deeply rooted, that the Vicissitudes
of many Ages have not been
sufficient to open Mens Eyes, or make
them sollicitous for the Truth. Of this
Sort was the Notion of Witches in the
World; for it is plain from Record, that
many poor Women were condemned to
the Flames or Gallows by the greatest
Sages in the Law; and the Sentences against
them were so arbitrary as never
to be mitigated, but hurled them to Destruction
without the least Regret or
Pity from the Witnesses of such Barbarity;
and yet how easy would it have
been to discern (if Men gave themselves
the Liberty to reflect a little upon the
Nature of the Thing) that no Guilt,
nor any such preternatural Knowledge
as was said to center in them, could proceed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lii"></a>[lii]</span>
from those ignorant simple People,
that were always the Subjects of this
Cruelty.</p>

<p>Thus it often fared with our reputed
Hermaphrodites, who have been banished,
tormented, abused, and employed
in such Offices as were in themselves severe;
cut off from the common Privileges
and Freedoms enjoyed by the Publick
wheresoever they have been; yea,
and put to Death in an inhuman and
pityless Manner. But the Disgrace
which hangs over human Nature, from
Mens harbouring such strange Notions
of one another, is almost as bad; and
more especially so, when several who
are ranked among Men of Science shall
espouse these Chimeras, or at least confess
a Doubt concerning the Thing: So
that it is not to be wondered at, if the
weak-minded and injudicious should be
impressed with a Belief of Reports of
this Kind, and thereby lose all Humanity
towards such Objects; and no wonder
modest Ears should be grated with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_liii"></a>[liii]</span>
the Stories of such Creatures, since they
are more frequently exposed to vast
Numbers of the indiscreet Part of the
World, than to Men of Knowledge and
Decency.</p>

<p>Since this is the Case, and since Authors,
of no little Account among the
Learned, have taken great Pains to confirm
the Certainty of the Existence of
Hermaphrodites in human Nature, and,
at the same Time, differ so much from
each other concerning them; it could
not but be very well worth while to attempt
finding the Truth of what, I so
much mistrusted, was asserted without
any just Foundation, and what I could
not but esteem a Scandal thrown upon
the whole Race of Mankind; and therefore,
upon seeing the Fœtus whose Description,
with an Observation upon all
female Fœtus’s, concludes the following
Pages, I was the more encouraged to
read upon and consider the Subject;
and finding myself unable to reconcile
the Accounts of Authors to Truth, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_liv"></a>[liv]</span>
the Nature of Hermaphroditism to the
Physiology of human Bodies, I was still
the more eager to endeavour at being satisfactory
to others as well as myself,
about what has been so long a Riddle.</p>

<p>The Arrival of the <i>Angolan</i> Woman
in Town encouraged this Undertaking,
both from the Belief of the Vulgar concerning
her, and the Sentiments of others,
who would allow her no Sex but the
Masculine; which rendered it not an unseasonable
Time to make a further Progress
in this Essay towards reducing the
Matter to a Certainty, which (however
deficient) I hope, will be in some Measure
acceptable to all Lovers of Truth in
Natural History.</p>

<p><i>Reasons against the Existence of an Hermaphrodital
Nature in human Bodies.</i></p>

</div>

<p>An Hermaphrodite is an Animal,
in which the two Sexes,
Male and Female, ought to
appear to be each distinct
and perfect, as well with regard to the
Structure proper to either, as to the Power<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
of exercising the necessary Offices and
Functions of those Parts. This Definition
naturally arises from the very Term,
and therefore, whatsoever is so accounted,
and fails of answering these Characters
in the most minute Particular, should be
consider’d in another light, and indeed
call’d by some other Name.</p>

<p>It would be an Injury to Truth to
deny the Existence of an Hermaphrodital
Nature, to all the animal World in
general; but however, I am inclin’d to
believe it is only proper to some Reptiles,
and but a few of these; for among the
several Tribes of larger Animals, whether
of the Air, Earth, or Waters, there seldom
are any, of late Years, to whom
this double Nature is ascribed, but those
of the Human; with how little Truth
or Reason, even to these, I hope to
make appear hereafter.</p>

<p>Whatever the Necessity might be for
the Creation of certain of the Reptiles of
this Nature, such as the Garden shell’d<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
Snail, and the large Earth-worm, both
of which are certainly so, which I can
affirm from my own Knowledge, having
often drawn both these asunder when in
Coition, and observ’d them; as well as
from so good Testimony, as Mr <i>Bradley</i>
in his Philosophical Account of the
Works of Nature<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>, where he has several
curious Observations on these Animals,
and a Figure of the Parts of Generation
of a Snail, done as they appeared in
a Microscope. As also from a Book intitled,
<i>Spectacle de la Nature</i>, which is
no less to be regarded than the former,
both for Truth and Accuracy. I say,
whatever may be the Cause of this, there
does not appear in Reason the least occasion
for it in larger Animals. As to
the former, if we may attempt to guess
at a Reason for their being thus created,
it may perhaps not be amiss to surmise as
follows, <i>viz.</i> We know these are very
slow Creatures in their Motions, and consequently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
their Congress is the more seldom;
and besides they are subject to so
many destroying Accidents, that if the
female Properties were but in one, it
would hardly be sufficient to preserve their
Species; hence it is that at the same Access
they both beget, and bear in a reciprocal
Manner. However, one Observation
worthy of note is, that though
they have a Capacity of both ways of
engendering, it must be remark’d, that
it is at the same Instant both are executed,
and not successively or by Choice,
being incapable of neglecting either to
chuse the other. Besides, we find they
are all so, through their whole Class;
which to them is the same strict Law
of Nature, that it is to other Animals to
possess but a single Sex. Nor can this
Law be ever violated in them, by any
Means whatsoever, any more than that
Law of Nature predominant in us should
digress from what it always was, or be
alter’d by any new Decree of the Divine
Will, whose Decrees are already fix’d
and unchangeable; our single Natures being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
sufficient to preserve the human Race,
in a successive Series, and their double
one being no more; which alone was
the Purpose of such Formations in all
animal Beings, and no other. But no such
Restraints attend larger Animals, and
therefore no such Nature is at all necessary
in them; however, tho’ all others
are limited to certain Seasons, as to their
generative Capacities, it is very strange
that no Appearance has ever been had of
two Sexes in any one upon Dissection,
(though many have been supposed of a
double Nature) but the human; who
have no limits set to their Powers of procreating,
and who on all accounts seem
to have the least need of any thing of
the Kind.</p>

<p>If it be objected that it happens not
to human Nature through any Necessity,
but only from a Lusus of Nature;
I answer, that no such Lusus can happen,
and it will be very evident, if we
only reflect a little upon the Nature of
Generation, which will be more amply<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
treated of in another Place; however,
one Principle will be sufficient to our
Purpose here, which is, that the Rudiments
or Parts of all Animals whatsoever
are already form’d in the Ovum<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>,
and that nothing can be produced by the
Males, but a Juice capable of giving Motion,
Explication, and Extension to those
Parts, and that since we know the common
Standard of Nature in human
Bodies is, that there should be but one
Sex in one Body, it is impossible that
there should be the least Imperfection in
the Rudiments of any one of the Ova,
since they were implanted in Females
from the Beginning of Time, by the
Almighty <i>Fiat</i>, and were under the Restriction
of that Law, that every Day’s
Experience confirms to us is certain; for
if there was not so absolute a Law, with
respect to the being of only one Sex in
one Body, we might then, indeed, expect
to find every Day many preposterous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
Digressions from our present Standard.
That there are certain Limits set
to the Things of Generation appears
no where better than when Animals of
different Species meet and copulate; the
Animal that is the Product of such a
Congress is in no wise capable of producing
an Off-spring like itself, to this
there is an absolute <i>ne plus ultra</i>, and
why? Because, indeed, if such were
capable of Generation, we should, by
degrees, have a new set of Heterogenous
Animals upon Earth. But it is plain,
it never was the Design of the Almighty,
since every Species of Animals are the
same now that they ever were, and we
must, from this Argument, expect no
other while time subsists. And indeed,
were we to have regard to the Notions
of some of the Ancients concerning Generation,
as, that the Male and Female
Semina meeting form’d a Child of either
Sex, according to the Predominance
of the Strength or Quantity of either
Semen, and if both were equal in
Quantity and Quality, a Child of both<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
Sexes was begotten, I say, were we to
have regard to this, we might still be
liable to be borne away by this Hypothesis,
as Authors have been hitherto, which
would inevitably seduce us to believe,
that there are Hermaphrodites in human
Nature. And therefore, whensoever
the Parts of both Sexes are seen distinct
in any Subject, they are not in the
same, but in different Bodies preternaturally
join’d, and coalesced together in
the Uterus, by Compression, Heat, Inflammation,
or some other such Accident;
of this there lately was an Example in
Town at <i>Charing-Cross</i>, which had the
Heads separate, and the Sexes appearing
considerable Distance from each other.
But who, with the least Propriety, can
call these an Hermaphrodite, each
Body having it’s peculiar Sex, and being
morbid in their Conjunction.</p>

<p>The Notions that sprung up in the
World concerning this Matter were (no
doubt) first taken from Appearances that
sometimes have happen’d of an extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
Elongation in the Clitorides
of Females; the first Idea conceiv’d from
thence must have been that of a Penis,
and the Appearance of a Vulva join’d to
it raised an Opinion of both Sexes in the
same Body; hence proceeded the Invention
of a proper Name for the surprising
Unity of both Sexes; and hence,
the Fictions of Poets, which the Learned
are well acquainted with. It will not
be very difficult to account in some Measure,
for the rise of such erroneous Imaginations,
if we only consider how ignorant
the World was in former Ages of the
animal Structure, and even of those that
understood ought of it, how few there
were, who (from the Obscurity of the
Clitoris in Females in a natural State)
knew that any such Part existed: It is
therefore not much to be wonder’d at,
that at the first Sight of a large Clitoris,
divers odd Conjectures should arise, and
supply the Fancy of those unskill’d in a
due Knowledge of the Part, with Matter
sufficient for the Erection of new
Doctrine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p>An Opinion of any kind, when once
on foot, is a Law to Posterity, till repealed
by the Doubts and Scrutinies of the
Learned and Curious. Doubt is the only
Path to Truth; for by this we examine,
search, and discern Truth from Error;
natural History affords Examples enough
of Falshoods copy’d and handed down
from Age to Age, through the whole
Class of Writers, who never doubted
each other, and consequently were never
able to know the Truth of Things, upon
which many Volumes have been
wrote; and it is matter of no small surprise,
that Authors never were able to
take the least hint from the Practice
of the People of some of the <i>Asiatick</i>,
as well as the <i>African</i> Nations, concerning
these large Clitorides; for as in
both these Parts of the World, the Women
have them most commonly very
long, and the People knowing that the
Length of them produces two Evils, <i>viz.</i>
the hindering the Coitus, and Womens
abuse of them with each other, wisely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
cut or burn them off while Girls are
young, and at the same time never entertain
the least Notion of the Existence of
any other Nature besides the Female in
those Subjects who are thus depriv’d of
that useless Part.</p>

<p>This Knowledge is not confin’d to
Men of Science alone amongst the
<i>Egyptians</i> and <i>Ethiopians</i>, nor indeed
amongst the <i>Asiaticks</i>; for every Parent
knows when the Child has this part
longer than ordinary, and performs the
Operation at a proper Time; which De
Graaff seems very much to approve<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>:
‘<i>And the Excision of this Part is as
necessary as it is decent to those
Eastern People.</i>’—Which was also
perform’d and taught, by several of the
ancient Physicians<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>, as particularly as
any other Operation whatsoever; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
yet even in our own Days, we find some
Anatomists of Repute confessing a double
Nature, and a Mixture of Sexes in the
same Body, and others calling the Labia
pudendi a divided Scrotum, and fancying
Urine and Semen to pass thro’ the Clitoris.
But it is observable, that where there is a
perfect Penis and Scrotum found in a
Child, there is never the least Sign of any
Part proper to a Female annexed to it;
but that, on the contrary, whatsoever
Subject is said to be an Hermaphrodite
has the <i>Feminine</i> Parts in Perfection,
and no Penis nor Scrotum, nor, according
to <i>De Graaf</i>’s Dissection, any Organ
serving to their Nutrition, Action,
Accretion, or any other Function, but
only the Clitoris (common to all Women)
somewhat larger than Ordinary, which
will fully appear when we come to
speak of him.</p>

<p>There are many Authors who have
given Histories of Women that have
been detected in the Abuse of such large
Clitorides, calling them Τριβας, Confricatrices,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
and the like, the Recital of one
from <i>Tulpius</i><a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> may not be amiss, who
after relating some Passages transacted
by one of these and a certain Widow,
makes this Reflection, ‘Though the
Clitoris for the most Part lies hid, yet
several have it so large, that they are
thought by the Ignorant to be transformed
into Men; but that this (whose
History he writes) was in all respects
a perfect Woman, having only the
Clitoris half a Finger’s Length.’ And
since this worthy Author has given us
this Story so suitable to our present Purpose,
it will not be unseasonable in this
Place, to take some Notice of a Memoir<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
in the Transactions of the <i>Royal Society</i>,
presented by one Dr <i>Thomas Allen</i><a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>, the
Subject of which he calls an uncommon
Lusus, and says, ‘This Hermaphrodite
is not to be reckon’d amongst
the Τριβαδες of the <i>Greeks</i>, nor to
be equal’d by any Description yet extant.’
These Τριβαδες were no more
than Women with Clitorides larger than
ordinary. Such of them as are so may
be capable, perhaps, of that Action from
whence the Name arose, whether they
perform it or not; and by considering
the Sequel of this History, we shall find
the Subject he describes to be no other
than a very Woman, such as <i>Tulpius</i>
has given the History of. He says, ‘at
six Years of Age, the Child playing
and wrestling with her fellow Children,
there appeared two Tumours
like Hernias, but they proved Testicles,
differing from those of a Man only in
this, that each had its own distinct<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
Scrotum; but in such a Manner, that
the Production of both form’d the
Labia of the Vulva.’</p>

<p>Our Author, after arming our Imaginations
with an Expectation of something
very extraordinary proceeds to describe
a true Female Child, only he would
allow her a Pair of Testes, but instantly
owns the Scrota of these form’d
the Labia. It would have been altogether
as well to have said at once, the Labia
were thicker than ordinary, for he could
not positively say they were Testes without
the Dissection of them, which was
out of his Power, since we find him
tracing her History to a more advanced
Age. But further, he proceeds thus:</p>

<p>‘In the Sinus, or Fissura Magna, the
Nymphæ and Carunculæ myrtiformes
appear’d entire, and half the Vulva
was cover’d with a thin Membrane
from the Perinæum; and there was no
Appearance of a Clitoris; the Uterus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
and its Neck were exactly like those
of a Female.’</p>

<p>What has this Author described here,
but a perfect Female? As to the
Nymphæ’s being entire, they are never
known to be otherwise, except a Dilaceration
of them happens by some violence;
the Carunculæ are indeed liable
upon slight Occasions to be broken,
however in so young a Subject it would
be very strange to find them so, therefore
there is nothing extraordinary in this
Part of his Description; but if he should
mean by the Word <i>entire</i>, that these two
Parts were conjoin’d together, his Notion
of them seems somewhat imperfect, for
the Nymphæ have their rise at the Clitoris,
and are lost on each Side before they
reach the Orifice of the Vagina; whereas
the Carunculæ Myrtiformes are within
the same, out of any Manner of Communication
with the former. The thin
Membrane<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> from the Perinæum that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
cover’d half the Orificium Vaginæ is
not an uncommon case; for in several
this Skin runs over the whole Part, and
therefore this, no more than any Part of
the above Description, is to be counted proper
to an Hermaphrodite. Again, there
was no Appearance of a Clitoris, and the
Uterus and its Neck were exactly like
those of a Female. Though the Clitoris
might have been then but small, yet that
she had it is most certain, for in some
they grow surprisingly in a little Time,
and what our Author calls a Penis afterwards
is nothing else; but how he could
find out that the Uterus and Cervix were
like others is a Riddle, since every Anatomist
knows how remote these are from
Sight in a living Subject.</p>

<p>At last he says, ‘she pass’d for a Woman
till the thirteenth Year,——when
kneading of Dough, all of a sudden,
a Penis broke forth, four Inches long
in an Erection, situated as in a Man,
with a Glans and Præputium fasten’d
to the Frænum, but the Glans being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
imperforated——deny’d egress to the
Semen, wherefore it made its way thro’
the Pudendum Muliebre, possibly in a
refluent Manner.’</p>

<p>It is no wonder she should pass for a
Woman, who, according to our Author,
had all the Feminine Parts to such Perfection;
and though the Accretion and
Protrusion of the Clitoris was never so
sudden, yet there is not the least Reason
to ascribe to her a virile Nature, because
the Female Parts remain’d as perfect as
before, without the lead Metamorphosis,
and she had her Menses regularly from
her sixteenth during the two following
Years, at which time, says our Author
they ceased, and she began to have a
Beard, Hair on her Body, Voice, Breasts,
Thorax, Ischia, and many other things
like those of a Man. However, this
sudden Growth of the Clitoris is not to
be credited, for those who shew a
Child of this Nature will tell any Lye
to render the Thing more surprising, as,
for example, who by reading the Bill of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
the little <i>French</i> Girl, could imagine any
other than that, in an erect Posture, she
was only 16 Inches high? Whereas
when her Limbs came to be view’d, the
Spectators found themselves mistaken,
for the Person never set forth in his Bill
that she sat when she was measured, or
that her Limbs were folded over each
other. Hence it appears that the Narrations
of these kind of Things are always
false, and the Subjects never answer
the Character or Description of them given
by the Owners.</p>

<p>The Doctor here believes the Man’s
Description of this Subject, and accordingly
gives the Memoir to the <i>Royal Society</i>;
but the Owner makes a Change
in his Story of the Girl when he carries
her to <i>Utrecht</i>, where he shew’d her
in 1668, at which time she was about
one or two and twenty Years old, being
born in <i>February</i> 1647, according to our
Author, and in that Town she had her
Menses regularly, which the Doctor says
stopp’d at her eighteenth Year; but the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
Variation made in the History of her
will farther appear, when we come to take
notice of <i>Diemerbroeck</i> who saw her at
that Town in <i>Holland</i>, and gives a History
of her in his Book of Anatomy.</p>

<p>The Doctor calls the Extremities of
the Nymphæ a Frænum, which he says
fasten’d the Glans and Præputium; for in
all Females of this kind, the Nymphæ arise
in an acute Angle on the under side of the
End of the Clitoris, which will appear
in our Description hereafter, but owns
‘the Glans was imperforated, wherefore
the Semen made its way through the
Pudendum Muliebre;’ it would have
been better and more judicious, not to
have said a Word of the Semen’s being
deny’d a Passage thro’ the Glans, and so
going back in a refluent Manner the
other Way, except he had a Mind to
demonstrate by what Road it had such a
refluent Passage. The inconsistencies
that appear thro’ this whole Narration
from first to last, should promise no great
Credit, for it is entirely taken from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
Owner of the Girl, and securely presented
to the <i>Royal Society</i>, without the
Author’s considering that no one Part of
his History can be reconciled to the
known Laws of the Structure of the human
Body. I should not omit in fine,
to take notice of one Word more,
‘That at the Sight of a Woman her
Penis was erected, and became flacid
at the Sight of a Man;’ from this I
can conceive no other, than that she had
more desire to the Woman than the
Man; and yet a little after he says, she
cast her Eyes upon a handsome Man
and fell in Love with him. But as I
have said above, <i>Diemerbroeck</i> will in his
turn illustrate more particularly how little
credit ought to be given to the Tales of
Shew-men, by the Learned.</p>

<p>It has been often argued by Authors,
that these Confricatrices are more inclined
to desire the Access of Women
than of Men, and being willing to favour
the Opinion of both Sexes being
found in one Person, draw from that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
Argument this Conclusion, that therefore
there must be as much of a Masculine
nature, as of a Female in them. To
this it is answer’d: That they do not desire
Women more than Men, from a
mere natural Inclination, but because by
a Gratification of this Nature there is
not so much danger of being expos’d;
therefore a Congress like this is the more
eagerly sought after, and agreed on by
two Females so inclin’d, since by an over
long Clitoris in one, both find their accounts
answer’d, without fear of that Accident,
that is the necessary Consequence
of dealing with Men; for that Part
being, as all allow, the Seat of great
Titulation, it is no wonder it should
be stimulated by being embraced in the
Vagina, nor that the Receiver should
also be effected by such Frication, as
well as by a Penis Virilis; thus I hope it
appears plainly that this Conclusion is ill
grounded.</p>

<p>Another Argument made use of is:
that those reputed Hermaphrodites have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
Beards like Men and Hair on some of their
Breasts. This can make but very little towards
proving a Masculine Nature in them;
for supposing some of these Fricatrices
to have Hair <i>&amp;c.</i> as above, yet there
are many Women with Hair between their
Breasts and on their Chins, who deserve no
such Repute; one I have often seen whose
Arms to the Fingers Ends were covered
with long black Hair, having a Beard
also on her Chin, who was the Wife of
a Man of Fortune by whom she had
eight or nine Children. I have also, at
the <i>Hôtel de Dieu</i> at <i>Paris</i>, seen a Body
open’d that was hairy in the same Manner,
without any Sign of a Masculine
Nature whatsoever. Again, several Women
advanced in Years have great Quantities
of Hair on the Chin, but the
Number of these as well as the former,
among Women, are but few; and those
that are so ought no more to have any
such Character ascribed to them, on that
account, than that many Men who want
Beards should be said to partake of a
Feminine Nature, and want the Power<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
of exercising the Functions of a Man;
but daily Experience shews us these are
as prolifick, and produce as many Signs
of Virility, as any others whatsoever.</p>

<p>There have been many Reports of
Persons who, in a certain Process of Time,
have been said to change their Sex; and
many<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Authors have handed such Accounts
with great Confidence to the rest
of Mankind, which, like a Contagion,
has infected them into a Belief of the
Matter; a brief View of the Source of
such Rumours may be of Use here, to
shew how credulous some have been in
receiving Stories of strange Things, and
how indolent and supine in finding out
the Truth of such.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<p>1. The First Origin or Reason of this
Notion then appears in the Account of
Dr <i>Allen</i>’s Hermaphrodite, <i>viz.</i> that the
Girl was changed into a young Man;
which is so clearly laid down already in
his Story, that here needs no Repetition.</p>

<p>2. The Second appears to be taken
from actual Male Children, who were
sometimes mistaken for Females at their
Birth, only from the Penis’s being as it
were shrunk into a Chink, and the Testes
also not yet fallen into the Scrotum,
which remaining so for some time till
(a proper Sense of the Sex beginning to
dawn in them) the Parts begin to swell,
and be protruded and extended towards
a natural Size. Thus several Children
have been, through Ignorance, baptized,
habited, and reputed Maidens; and, upon
the aforesaid Protrusion of the Parts, said
to change their Sex and be transformed
into Men; which many Writers have
taken Pains to maintain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>Of this Nature, was one seen by <i>Casp.
Bauh.</i><a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>, and <i>Fæl. Plat</i>, who was called
<i>Anne</i>, about 23 Years old, and was hir’d
as a Maid Servant to a Countryman; The
Master observ’d, that this Servant, upon
some Occasions, was in greater favour
with his Wife, than himself; and therefore
brought the Affair before a Magistrate,
who committed the Examination
of the Person to these two Physicians,
the former of whom gives the following
Account of the Matter<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p>‘He was tall and thin, having a Masculine
Voice, a long Head of Hair,
and only some softish Hairs on his Chin,
(for he us’d to pluck his Beard with a
Tweezer as fast it grew) he had no
Breasts, but was hairy about the Pubis,
and had a long Penis, and the Præputium
drawn back and well worn; he had
no Scrotum nor Testes that were visible:
Under the Penis, in the Perinæum,
where Lithotomy is commonly perform’d,
there was a kind of Chink,
about half a Finger’s Joint deep, <i>&amp;c.</i>
from all which we judg’d him a Man
rather than a Woman. Being ask’d
concerning his venereal Performances,
he confess’d, that he had cohabited<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
with several Whores, with a seminal
Ejection and much Pleasure; and further,
that whenever he had to do with
any, or ever had an Erection of his
Penis, a Testicle swell’d in his Right-Groin,
(for sometimes the Testes do
not descend into the Scrotum, but remain
in the Inguina) which we perceiv’d
by touching, but that on the
left Side, nothing was to be perceiv’d
neither during the Coitus nor otherwise;
nor did any thing ever flow from
the aforesaid Rima or Chink.’</p>

<p>Here was therefore a perfect Man,
mistaken for a Female Child at the Birth,
on account of the invisibility of the
Testes, and the Appearance of that superficial
Chink in the Perinæum<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>.</p>

<p>3. A Third Reason for such Reports
has been taken from Boys having been
concealed in Female Dresses, for some
political or family Occasions, and so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
continu’d under that Acceptation, till either
Matters came to such a Crisis as
render’d their Case less dangerous, or
till Beards and other Signs of Virility
have occasion’d a Declaration of their
true Sex, and a Change of Habit. The
Vulgar now make a Rumour of a miraculous
Change in Children, whom they
before accepted of as Females; the Report
takes wing, and is catch’d by several
who commit the Story superstitiously to
Posterity, without any Manner of Enquiry
into the Nature of the Thing.</p>

<p>A Case of this Nature is cited by <i>Diemerbroeck</i>,
which happen’d in the Time
of <i>Ferdinand</i> I, King of <i>Naples</i>; it was
of two Children, who were call’d <i>Carola</i>
and <i>Francisca</i>, and were reported to have
changed their Sexes upon the Appearance
of Beards growing on them, which
their Mother gave out was miraculously
done, upon which she changed their
Habits for those of Men. The Story
reached <i>Fulgosus</i>’s Ears, and he wrote it
confidently and securely, and yet our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
Author <i>Diemerbroeck</i> discredits it very
much, since the Rumour proceeded from
the Mother and no other Witness, with
whom the rational Part of the World
must concur.</p>

<p><i>Johan. Bauhin.</i> furnishes <i>Skenckius</i><a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
with a History of a young Man, who
was thought to be a Girl, by all his Acquaintance;
because he sat in the Manner
of Women to make Water, which was
occasion’d by the Glans Penis’s being
imperforated, and having a Passage for
Urine under the Penis; he lay with Women
and was dress’d and employ’d as
one all his Life; and dying of a Pestilential
Disease, was, by order of a Magistrate,
open’d, and found to be a perfect
Man in all respects, without any
Part proper to the other Sex in the
least.</p>

<p>In all probability, if he had been detected,
when alive, he would have pretended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
a miraculous Change of Sex as
did the Mother of the above <i>Carola</i> and
<i>Francisca</i>.</p>

<p>There<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> was an Opinion amongst the
<i>Greek</i> and <i>Arabian</i> Physicians, concerning
a great Analogy between the Male
and Female Genitals as to their Structure,
who strenuously assert, that these
differ in nothing but their Situation, that
is, they compare the Cervix and Vagina
Uteri to the Penis, and the Fundus
to the Scrotum, only they are inverted
or rather not protruded, and that which
hinders their Protrusion in Women, according
to these Authors, is the want of
Heat and sufficient force of Nature. It
would be a Digression from our present
Purpose, if we should enter upon a comparative
View of the Parts of Generation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
of both Sexes, and endeavour to confute
those Chimeras, and therefore the Use that
is at present necessary to be made of this
Opinion, is only to shew that this was
another Origin from whence these Reports
of such Metamorphoses have sprung
and been encouraged, as well as any of
those others already taken notice of.
For admitting that Hypothesis, <i>viz.</i>
that every Woman is a Man, if she had
but heat of Temperament and Strength
sufficient to drive the inside of the
Uterus, <i>&amp;c.</i> outward, and that that Inversion
should form a Penis and Scrotum,
which was the general Notion amongst
some of the Learned a long time after
<i>Galen</i>; I say, admitting this was now
the reigning Notion, we should upon
the least Appearance of any thing strange
in the Parts of Generation, be as ready
still to acquiesce to any Rumour of the
Change of Sex, <i>&amp;c.</i> as ever, having so
easy a Manner of accounting for it,
as the <i>Calor eximius &amp; Naturæ Vis</i>,
which was the fashionable Cause to which
Changes of this Nature were always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
ascribed, both by the <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Arabians</i>.</p>

<p>It will not be improper here to observe,
that all these Changes in the Sex
were most commonly said to be made
from Women to Men; and I never
could hear any Account whatsoever
of Mens being chang’d into Women,
but two or three, one of which happened
here in <i>London</i>; the Story will not
only be of use to our Purpose, but a
merry one, and therefore take it briefly
as follows: At a great Tavern in <i>London</i><a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>,
there lived, some few Years ago,
two Drawers who were a considerable
Time Servants in the House, and always
lay together; one of them gets the other
with Child, who was with a great deal
of Shame and Confusion turn’d away,
and oblig’d then to put on Womens
Clothes. The Rumour of the Drawer’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
being chang’d into a Woman made a
great Noise all over the Neighbourhood,
and very likely would have been recorded
for Truth, if it had happen’d in an Age
little earlier.</p>

<p>Here was a poor Girl whose Parents
ignorantly believing she was a Boy from
the Length of the Clitoris, dress’d her
up, and employ’d her as such in the
Business of Life; she no doubt believ’d
herself so, until she was better instructed
by her Fellow-Servant; and here is Matter
and Foundation, altogether as probable
and sufficient for Poets or Historians
to build upon, as any heretofore
taken notice of; and, in fine, hence it
plainly appears, that it is with equal right,
that human Nature may be said to be
capable of admitting of two Natures
Male and Female, in one Body, and of
changing from one Sex to the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p>Another is told by<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> <i>Caspar Bauhin</i>.
of a Child who was baptized as a Male,
and was brought up a Taylor by Trade,
went afterwards into the Army, and
serv’d as a Soldier both in <i>Hungary</i> and
<i>Flanders</i>, marry’d a Wife, and liv’d
seven Years with her, at the End of
which, our Soldier one Night rose from
the Wife, complaining of great pains in
the Belly, and in half an Hour, was delivered
of a Daughter. When the Story
came before the Magistrates, an Examination
was made, and the poor Female
Soldier confess’d herself of both Sexes,
and that a <i>Spaniard</i> had cohabited with
her once (only) in <i>Flanders</i>, by which
she proved with Child; that the Wife
had concealed her want of what might
be expected from a Husband, with whom
she never was able to act in any wise,
during their (seven Years) living together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>The Author introduces this Story in the
following Words<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>. ‘As the following
History is of no small Importance in
explaining the Nature of Hermaphrodites,
I have translated it thus from the
<i>German</i> Language.’ From which
Words it appears, that he had a very just
Notion concerning them, and was so far
from making such things Prodigies, being
well versed in the Knowledge of the Animal
Structure, that he counts the History
of this, and another Soldier whom <i>Keckermannus</i>
gives an account of, sufficiently
explicatory of the Nature of Hermaphrodites
in general.</p>

<p>The Parents of these could have no
other Motive for thinking these Creatures
Boys, than the Length of the Clitoris;
which is plain from their bearing Children<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
when they came to Age; and if
any thing of a Masculine Nature was in
the Soldier, it could surely in seven
Years Acquaintance have been exerted
to the Gratification of a Wife, or would
have produced some other Effects very
different from that of being got with
Child.</p>

<p><i>An historical and critical Account
of the Causes of Hermaphrodites.</i></p>

</div>

<p>If Hermaphrodites actually existed,
sure there might have been before
now some probable Conjectures made
to shew the Reasons, or Necessity of
such Beings upon Earth, since so many
Authors have been busy’d about them
from the Beginning of the World. But
there appears throughout their several
Opinions, so general a Train of Absurdities,
that I cannot but wonder, they
were any more satisfactory to Mankind
in their Days than they are to me at present.
However, when the several Causes
laid down by certain Authors from Time
to Time, for the producing of those
Creatures, are consider’d, it will not be
difficult Matter to point out innumerable
Errors amongst them, and deny<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
that those Causes can produce any such
Effect as a double Nature in human
Bodies.</p>

<p>The first then that I shall take notice
of is that of <i>Constantinus Africanus</i><a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>,
who accuses Nature of being hindered,
or of forgetting its duty in the Formation
of the Fœtus, and by this Mistake
Hermaphrodites are generated.</p>

<p>‘<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>It happens to some Men, in Generation,
to have added to them those
Female Parts, and to some Women
those Masculine Parts that are luxuriant
in them, when Nature is hinder’d, or
grows forgetful; for when by any Accident<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
it happens thus, that Superfluity
of humid Matter that usually contributes
to either the inordinate Size or
Number of any Limb, goes to the
Formation of a Member of any other
Nature without Rule or Order.’</p>

<p>Before we can in any wise understand
whether the Cause assigned by this Author
be just or not, we must guess at
what he means by the Word <i>Nature</i>.</p>

<p>Amongst the Poets, and some Philosophical
Authors, <i>Natura</i> and <i>Deus</i> may
be conceived to signify the same Thing;
in this Sense, not the least Impediment
can be ascribed, nor Oblivion attributed
to it.</p>

<p>If it be a Term used to hint at the
<i>Vis Formatrix</i>, or at the Matter of
which the Fœtus is form’d, his Reason
for giving this as a Cause will appear
to be as ill grounded as any other; because
as to the latter, all reasonable Men
must allow, that as Matter is totally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
passive, it cannot be said to err or forget;
and as to the former, if such an
occult Power existed, it must have been
by God’s Appointment, and consequently
not liable to such Imperfections, in
conducting so great a Work as that of
Generation, with which so many Authors
have taken much pains to charge
this Vis Plastica; but of both these in
another Place.</p>

<p><i>Avicenna</i><a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> sums up a great many
Causes for Masculinity and Femineity,
as his Translator <i>Gerardus Cremonensis</i>
translates it: For the former, or the Production
of Males, the Heat and Abundance
of the <i>Sperma virile</i>; its being
promoted from the right Testicle; because
(according to our Author) it is of a thicker
Consistence, more hot, and drawn from
the Right-Rein, <i>è rene dextro</i>; which
is, says he, both warmer and higher than
the other as being nearer the Liver; its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
falling into the right Side in the Coitus,
<i>&amp;c.</i> and that on the other Hand Females
are engender’d by Causes contrary to
these: All these Opinions he has gather’d
from <i>Hypocrates</i>, <i>Galen</i>, and <i>Rhasus</i>,
and because he does not seem in the
least, to contradict them, we are inclin’d
to believe them his own also.</p>

<p>Now from this Manner of accounting
for Masculinity and Femineity, or the
Production of Males and Females, there
arises a third Doctrine to which this
Author seems to assent, and by which
he accounts for the rise of Hermaphrodites;
and tho’ he confesses that some
say so; which signifies he has it from
others, yet he delivers it with an Air of
Approbation, and consequently was not
displeased with the Hypothesis<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>‘And some say, that if it runs from the
Right-side of the Man to the same of
the Woman, it produces a Male; and
from their Left-sides a Female; and if
from the Man’s Left-side to the Right
of the Woman, the Production will be
a masculine Woman; but if from his
Right, to her Left-side, it will be a
feminine Male.’</p>

<p>If the old Doctrine<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> of Males being
proper to the Right-sides, and Females
to the Left, of both Sexes, in the Act of
Generation, were true, (which cannot
but seem obsolete before even a Capacity
of the lowest Class) this crossing the
Strain, in the Manner he relates, might
hold, and would not be an unpleasant
Method of explaining the Nature of the
Growth of these Androgyni; but I believe,
that Notion is so much exploded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
already, as not to need taking pains to Invalidate.</p>

<p>Let us, however, accept it as this Author’s
Opinion, and a Variety from that
of any other; and proceed to shew, that
<i>Lemnius</i> has mistaken <i>Avicenna</i>, when
he ascribes to him the Opinion contained
in the following Words<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>.</p>

<p>‘When the Menses have come down,
and the Uterus is cleansed, which happens
about the fifth or seventh Day,
if a Man cohabits with a Woman any
time from the first to the fifth after they
have ceased, a Male will be begotten;
from thence to the eighth a Female;
again from that to the twelfth a Male;
but after that an Hermaphrodite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p>For the Words of <i>Avicenna</i> according
to <i>Gerrard</i>’s Translation, are very different
from the above quoted by <i>Lemnius</i>,
tho’ they import the same thing; yet they
are far from being his Opinion, because he
plainly rejects it as unreasonable, having
it from another<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Author, thus <i>Avicenna</i><a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>:</p>

<p>‘And some of them say, who speak
without Reason, <i>&amp;c.</i>’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>Now since he absolutely declares, they
who think thus are without Reason, it
follows that <i>Lemnius</i> had no right to
quote him, for the only Opinion he
dislikes, of those contained in the whole
Chapter; but to whomsoever the Opinion
belongs, there is a Necessity for the following
Animadversions upon it.</p>

<p>If a limited Time was necessary thus
for the procreating of the different Sexes,
as, that for the first five Days after the
Cessation of the menstrual Discharge,
Males only are begotten, it should have
been universally known by Experience
long ago, since the Opinion was as early as
<i>Avicenna</i>; and none of those that we daily
see very anxious for Male Heirs, would
ever want them, if their Consorts were
breeding Women, and this the Case.
Again, no Lady that languishes for a
little Daughter amongst her Sons, would
be long in Pain about it, if she could by
Coition at any certain Time be capable
of chusing one; nor in fine, would any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
such Appearance happen in human Nature,
as is erroneously reputed Hermaphrodital,
if such were never produced, but
after the twelfth Day from those times of
the Menses; for Mankind would, at
such Seasons, avoid the Act of Generation;
lest Beings so infamous, as they
are superstitiously thought, should be the
Product of their Embraces.</p>

<p>‘Yet, notwithstanding <i>Avicenna</i> (says
<i>Lemnius</i><a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>) does not account for this
Doctrine, I will endeavour to reason
upon it, and support it;’ which is an
Evidence that he was so fond of it, that
besides laying it down as the Opinion of
the former, in order to gain the more
Credit for the Notion, he runs into an
anatomical Way of enlarging on it; the
bare Recital of which, without the least
Animadversion on it, will be sufficient to
shew every judicious Reader, how Errors
beget Errors, and may successively do so,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
to the End of time, whilst an implicit
Credit is given to Mysteries of this
kind<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span></p>

<p>‘For at first, when the Uterus is
cleansed by the Expurgation of the
Humours, it acquires greater Heat,
whereby the Semen Virile mixes the
more powerfully with that of the Female,
and is directed into the right Sinus
of the Uterus, by the attractive
Force of the Liver and right Kidney,
from whence also, in these first Days,
warm Blood is derived, to the Nutrition
of the future Fœtus: Nor can the
Parts on the left Side, being then cold,
and void of Blood, immediately after
the menstrual Discharge, contribute
any thing; but Blood is by degrees
drawn from the emulgent Veins of
the left Side, which go into the Spleen
and Kidney, so that, from the fifth to
the eighth Day, some Blood flows
from them, whereby the Fœtus is to
be nourished; thus a Female is formed
when these Parts compass their Strength,
or are esteem’d as those of the Right
out of their Situation, and also on Account
of the Coldness of the Aliment.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
After the eighth Day, the Parts on
the Right-side take the Office of preparing
the Blood, which again begins
to flow freely from them for the
Growth of a Male.</p>

<p>‘After this Number of Days, because
the menstrual Blood flows promiscuously,
and the Matrix becomes too
moist by the Afflux of cold Humours,
and the Blood not being determin’d
to either Part, but fluctuating in the
middle of the Uterus, the Semina being
there confus’d together produce an Hermaphrodite;
which, when conceiv’d,
receives Strength and Form sometimes
from the right and sometimes from the
left Sinus, enjoying the Efforts of both;
Hence <i>Androgyni</i> or Hermaphrodites
spring up.’</p>

<p>Tho’ <i>Lemnius</i><a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> has made so large a
Comment upon that Sentence, which he
would have us take for <i>Avicenna</i>’s Opinion,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
he is fond of giving another Opinion
of his own, which he supposes to
account for Hermaphroditism, and that
is, any unusual or indecent Execution of
the Coition.</p>

<p>‘Sometimes this infamous Conception
is form’d from an indecent and
unusual Copulation, as when the Man
is supine, and the Woman prone in
the Act, <i>&amp;c.</i>’<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>That this cannot be the Cause of
Hermaphrodites is evident from this short
Reflection, <i>viz.</i> That since the Fœcundation
of the Ovum which contains the
Fœtus, depends upon something immitted
from the Penis, I believe it matters
not in what manner that Ceremony is
perform’d, provided that End is answer’d;
and therefore Fœcundation cannot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
be alter’d, nor the Seminium changed,
by any Variety in the Position of the
two Sexes whatsoever, during the Act of
Generation; for the Effect of the fœcundating
Juice will be always the same
upon the Ovum howsoever it is injected.</p>

<p><i>Dominicus Terrelius</i><a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> imagines, the
Cause to be in the Position of the Female,
immediately after the Coitus.</p>

<p>‘After a Woman has receiv’d the
Semen Virile into the Uterus, care must
be had of the Position of her Body;
which ought not to be supine, because
then the Semen, remaining in the
middle of the Uterus, does not become
either a Male or Female absolutely,
but both together which is call’d
an Hermaphrodite.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p>And tho’ this Author does not seem
to think of a Number of Cells in the
Uterus, yet according to his Notion for
this Doctrine, he supposes Nourishment
is drawn from each side of the Uterus to
the Center, where he says the Semen is
lodg’d, and being somewhat different,
as to their Heat and Cold, the Mixture
of these two kinds of Nourishment
causes a promiscuous Sex; which he
compares to certain Women of <i>Tuscany</i>
call’d <i>Lunenses</i>, who, says he, being
careless of their Position after the Reception
of the seminal Matter in Coitu,
brought forth many Hermaphrodites
from time to time.</p>

<p>Now, that the Semen should lodge in
the Middle of the Uterus, and not in
the rest of its Cavity, is very strange,
since there is but one Cavity, and no
manner of Partition to confine it in one
part more than another; and as to the
Capacity of the Cavity of the Uterus, it
is known to be very small, insomuch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
that if we may suppose any of that Matter
passes into it, it is impossible but the
whole must be fill’d, considering the
Quantity of that Fluid that is generally
injected at such Times.</p>

<p>But how ridiculous a Notion must it
be, that in so small a thing as the Uterus,
when empty, a hot nutritious Juice
should occupy one side, and a cold one
the other; besides, if it were incumbent
on Women, after Coition, to place themselves
in a certain Position, for fear of
having monstrous Children, there would
certainly be great danger of the Produce
of many; for we may be confident no
such Care is taken at those times, by
any Woman whatsoever.</p>

<p><i>Empedocles</i> thinks, that in the Formation
of Hermaphrodites, the Parts of
the different Sexes are drawn from the
Parents in the Coitus; that is, those of
the Male from the Male Parent, and
those of the Female from the contrary
Sex that begets them. These two Sexes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
join’d in one Fœtus, constitute the double
Sex, and an Hermaphrodite is form’d.
His Words according to <i>Caspar Bauhin</i><a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
are,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Αλλὰ διέσπασται μελέων φύσις, ἡ μὲν</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">ἐν ανδρος, ἡ δ’ ἐν γυναικος,——</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>If we must, from this Opinion, suppose,
that no Particle in the Semen
Virile can contain any thing that might
contribute to the Formation of a female
Part of Generation, nor in the Semen
Muliebre to that of the Parts of the
Male; It is to be much fear’d, something
absurd must be the Consequence;
for allowing that Hypothesis held and
receiv’d by <i>Hypocrates</i>, <i>Galen</i>, and many
of the Learned that followed them,
that the Fœtus is always form’d of both
these Semina mingled together, it must
follow, from the Notion held by <i>Empedocles</i>,
that no other than a Child of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>two Sexes could be produced, and consequently
the entire Race of Mankind
must have been Hermaphrodites, since
it was necessary both should contribute
something, in order to consummate the
Act of Generation. Or else, that if the
Females should have no such Matter,
as is call’d Seminal, that of the Males
would always produce a Male by virtue
of theirs alone, when injected into
the Female.</p>

<p>But we are, according this Hypothesis,
at a terrible Loss to know (if the Males
had no seminal Matter) how a Female
could be produced, tho’ the latter were
never so well stored with such female
seminal Matter; because, the former
being without it, there could be no consummate
Coitus, and consequently no
Female; so that, to sum up this Opinion,
we must conclude, if both contribute,
Hermaphrodites must ensue; if
the Males only, Males must only be
born; but if Males have nothing to
emit, neither Male nor Female could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
be begotten, and Generation must drop
by Degrees.</p>

<p>The Opinion of <i>Parmenides</i>, an ancient
<i>Greek</i> Author, appears in the following
Lines, translated by <i>Cælius Siciensis</i>,
from his Book which he wrote of
Nature, concerning Hermaphrodites being
produced<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>.</p>

<p>‘When the Semina of a Man and
Woman are mixed together, the forming
Virtue, preserving a due Moderation
and Temperature, will produce Bodies
properly made; for if there be an Opposition
of the said Virtue in the mingled
Semen, she unhappily implants in the
Fœtus a double Sex.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span></p>

<p>Here is the <i>Vis Informans</i> accused
of Opposition or Neglect in resisting, or
letting the Semina go on their own way
in the Formation of the Fœtus, which is
much the same with <i>Constant</i>. <i>Africanus</i>’s
Accusation of Forgetfulness or Impediment;
and therefore what is said under
that Author, will suffice for the rendering
this Opinion also of little Worth.</p>

<p>The Principles laid down by <i>Averroës</i><a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
are no less particular than others just
mentioned; he says, The Semen Muliebre
abounds with, or is constituted of, Particles
adapted to the Nature of every
Member in the Body, and in order to
account for a Superfluity of Members in
a Body, he draws this Conclusion from
thence; that if the seminal Matter in a
Female is more than is necessary for
the Formation of one Child, and less
than will make two, the superfluous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
Part will form superfluous Limbs to the
one Child, according to the Nature of
the Particles it contains; that is, if it
consists of Particles fit for the Head,
there will be two Heads, and so of the
Hands, Feet, <i>&amp;c.</i> and then he adds<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>,
‘The Cause is much the same, when the
Parts of Generation of both Sexes exist
in any Person.’ And that on the other
Hand, if their be a Deficiency of the
seminal Matter, some Limb or other
must be wanting.</p>

<p>If this be thought a just Hypothesis,
then we cannot but suppose, there is
a great and most miserable Restraint upon
the whole animal Part of the Creation;
for if it be absolutely necessary that such a
certain Quantity (and no more, nor less)
is to be expended on the compleating of a
proportionable Fœtus, I am of Opinion
that not one third of the Animals of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
World would escape being Monsters;
and the Art and Business of Physicians
would be more requisitely employed in
ordering Regimens, and Calculations towards
the fixing the Sustenance and
other Non-naturals, in such Proportion
to every Animal, as should produce in
each an exact limited Quantity of
seminal Matter, than in curing Diseases.</p>

<p>But besides adjusting the necessary Quantity
of such seminal Matter, it would be
no less difficult to calculate a Proportion
of Particles for each Part, since our Author
makes some Head-Particles, some
for the Feet, and so of the rest; least,
tho’ the Quantity in the whole may be
just enough, yet, the Head Particles, for
example, might be too many, when
there might at the same time be less of
any other Part; so that according to this
Notion, a Child might be begotten with
a Head and half, and but half a Foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span></p>

<p>But <i>Gorræus</i> differs from <i>Averroës</i>, as
<i>Liebaultius</i> relates, who would not place
the Cause of Hermaphrodites in the whole
seminal Mass, but only in those Parts of
it that are chiefly concern’d in contributing
to the Formation of the Parts of
Generation of both Sexes; and therefore,
so general a mistake is not to be ascribed
to him, as to the former, tho’ his Supposition
is altogether as ill grounded.</p>

<p><i>Peucerus</i><a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> comes into a Class with
<i>Averroës</i>, but tacks some little Addition
to the Doctrine of the latter, of a Superabundance,
or Scarcity in any Parts of
the Semen, their producing a Superfluity
or want of any of the Members of the
Body; he says<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>‘If for making two Bodies the Matter
is deficient, but is too much for one,
the Vis Plastica forms more Limbs
than are natural.’ A little after he
adds<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>,</p>

<p>‘In this Manner Hermaphrodites
and Androgyni are begotten, who
have the Parts of both Sexes; although
one of them may be weaker and of
less Efficacy than the other, and sometimes
it happens that one may be
changed or quite abolish’d.’</p>

<p>This Opinion in general is pretty near
that of the former Author; but when he
says, that one of the Sexes in an Hermaphrodite
may be changed, or quite destroyed,
it is somewhat obscure, and difficult to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
reconcile to the first Part of his Opinion;
for first, he says, pursuant to the same
Cause, of the Redundancy of such and such
Matter, Hermaphrodites arise, ‘quibus
sexus utriusque membra insunt,’ and
then, <i>altho’ one of the Sexes may be weaker
and of no Efficacy</i>; nay, <i>sometimes one
may be changed or quite abolish’d</i>. Indeed
when he says, that one of the Sexes in
an Hermaphrodite is of no Efficacy, he is
right; for our reputed Androgyni, which
are the Macroclitorideæ, have one of
theirs so, which is the Clitoris; and
consequently ought to be deny’d the
Character of an Hermaphrodite; but
when he says, one of the Sexes is
chang’d, he can, with less right, call
them Hermaphrodites. If one be changed,
it must be to some other Sex;
and as there are but two, then there
must be a double Male or female Sex,
upon the Alteration, and all this, after
they have become of this double Nature,
according to the Cause in the first Part
of his Opinion; for a Change is consequent
to the former State of the thing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
changed. But, in fine, when one Sex is
abolish’d, there ought to remain but a
perfect Man, or Woman; how therefore
can this most unaccountable Variety
be said to proceed from a Redundancy of
Particles of any kind whatsoever.</p>

<p><i>Pontanus</i><a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>, besides being of the
same Opinion with <i>Averroës</i>, seems also
to lay a great deal of blame to Heat, by
which I suppose, he means the Calor
Nativus, because he says<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>,——he endeavours
to make this plain, by likening
Generation to a Vessel of Water on a
Fire; alledging that a gentle Heat will
render the Water hot, as well as an inordinate
one; and that, as by a very
great Heat, the Water will be subject to
a total Evaporation, so the Oeconomy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
of Generation may be destroyed, or become
monstrous or preposterous by the same.
Innate Heat is indeed a necessary Quality
that attends every Part as well
as Action of animal Bodies; but I
cannot conceive any Excess of Heat in
such Bodies, but what is symptomatick
of some morbid State, and therefore
not to be assign’d as a Cause for any
effect, whether regular or irregular, in
Generation.</p>

<p>By this Author’s laying so much Stress
upon inordinate Heat, one would imagine,
he had nothing else to blame for
causing Hermaphrodites; yet he joins
with <i>Peucerus</i> so as to mention his very
Words<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>, in consequence of this Notion
of a Superfluity of Particles producing
more Members than are natural; and
makes an offer at explaining this also
in the following Manner; however inartful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
and unreasonable, let every Reader
judge<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>.</p>

<p>‘When therefore this acting or procreating
Virtue directly influences either
Sex, so as to conquer or quite
overcome, Women bring forth Children
of either Sex; but where she
partly conquers and partly is subdued,
then the thing is otherwise conducted,
and one both Male and Female is begotten.’</p>

<p>By this Manner of accounting for it,
we are to suppose, when the <i>Vis Agens</i>
chiefly predominates over the Materia
Seminalis, the Male Sex is begotten;
and when the seminal Matter totally rules
the Vis Agens, a Female is produced;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
but if the latter is partly conquer’d and
partly overcomes, then one of both Sexes
is the Consequence.</p>

<p>How inconsiderately does this Author
give way to an erroneous Principle?
For it is very plain to all Capacities, if
it be necessary that such a Power as he
calls his Vis Agens should accompany
and direct the seminal Matter, in order
to assist, and carry on, the Work of Generation,
that whensoever she was so
overcome, as not to have any concern in
the Work, or act upon the seminal
Matter, it ought to be deprived of any
Manner, or Power, of growing into
any Form whatsoever; whereas, by
our Author’s System, we find, that when
this Vis Agens has any thing to do, it is
only towards the Formation of a Male;
because if she be, as he expresses it,
overcome, the Matter will produce a
Female of itself; so that, an Hermaphrodite
cannot be formed, till the
Matter and the Vis Agens quarrel,
and strive for Mastership, when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
in the Scuffle, each contributes something
towards its favourite Sex, and a fœtus
of both Sexes is made; yet he does not
say both are perfect; for, as we observ’d
before, he says one is obscure, so that
in the Dispute they never come off equal;
and this he proves in these Words<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>;
‘Nature in Mankind in general distinguishes
the Male from the Female, so
that both Sexes cannot exist in the same
Body, in their proper degrees of Perfection.’</p>

<p>This last Opinion is not consistent
with the rest, because, according to his
first Principles, there should be an absolute
Male or Female, just as either prevail’d
over the other; and an Hermaphrodite,
when each was so stubborn, as to
force in upon the poor Fœtus it’s different
Sex.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<p>The <i>contrary Qualities</i> of <i>Albertus
Magnus</i><a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> in their Strife about the Formation
of the Fœtus, are not much unlike
the foregoing Hypothesis; he says, ‘When
contrary Qualities join together in
the Body, either of which is absolute,
and, by the help of the Vis Formativa,
capable of terminating in a different
Sex, that then Hermaphrodites are begotten<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>.’</p>

<p>I should be glad to find out what these
Qualities are, for as the Matter is stated
it is hard to apply it; however therefore,
if by the Contumacy of these
Qualities, a Fœtus may be impressed
with two Sexes, we must conclude
that human Nature is very unhappy under
the Guidance of such capricious Directors;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
but he ought here more particularly
to lay the blame to the Vis Formatrix;
for tho’ according to him either
quality may be complexional of and terminating
in its Sex; yet, these are but as
Instruments made use of by the Vis Formatrix,
to work upon the Matter withal;
and therefore, the Tools used by a
Workman may be as well blamed for
making a bad Piece of Work, as these
supposed Qualities; but as this Hypothesis
in general, is as weak as any of the former,
enough is said of it; let us therefore
pass on to another, in which we
shall find a great Variety.</p>

<p>Not a few old Authors<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> imagined
there were several Cells and Ditches in
the Uterus for the Reception of
Fœtus’s of the different Sexes; and those
who were of Opinion that the Cells were
but seven, thought that three were on
the Right-side for Males; as many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
on the Left, for Females; and the seventh
in the middle for Hermaphrodites;
which were generated, whenever the Semen
Virile happen’d to fall into it.
Another<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> supposes but three, one on
each side for Males and Females, and
the central Cell for Androgyni; and that
‘Nature always intends the Formation
of a Male, being inclin’d to form the
best; that a Woman is but a Man,
having an accidental Change in the Parts,
and is therefore a Monster in Nature;
that a Male is always begotten, but because
of the ill Disposition of the Matrix
and the Object it contains, and the
Inequality of the Semen, (whensoever
Nature cannot accomplish the Formation
of a perfect Man) a Female or
Hermaphrodite must be the Consequence<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p>If Nature intended the Procreation
of no Sex but the Male, there would
have been no Female; but if it was, at
first, necessary, that a Female should accompany
the Male in order to propagate
their Likeness and Species, without which
(it is evident) Generation could neither have
been begun nor carry’d on, the same Necessity
must always hold, and a Race of Females
as well as Males ought always to
continue, in order to carry on that great
Work. How then are Women Monsters
in Nature?</p>

<p>The first Woman as well as the first
Man, when created, were endowed with
different Organs serving to Generation, tho’
in all other Respects alike in their Members;
and since every Woman afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
had no difference in the Formation
of those Parts, but must have been exactly
the same with her Female Predecessors,
even back to the first; by what
Reason can her Parts be accounted monstrous
or accidentally changed?</p>

<p>Besides, whatsoever is monstrous in
Nature ought to be of no further Use in
the Oeconomy of that particular System to
which it properly may be said to belong,
if in a natural State. But this Hypothesis
is of such a Nature, as scarce to be
worth taking any more trouble to confute,
being the produce of a mere Monster
in Nature.</p>

<p>St <i>Augustin</i>,<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> who was more inclin’d
to deal in Matters metaphysical than natural,
makes a long detail of several
Kinds of Cripples, and what he calls
monstrous Kinds of Men, such as, those
having but one Eye in the Forehead,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
Pigmies, Sciopoda’s, Cynocephales, and
such like; and proposes this Question:
Whether it was from <i>Adam</i>, or the Sons
of <i>Noah</i>, that such Kinds of Men had proceeded?
But seems to believe that whatsoever
they be, they were brought upon
the Earth by the special Appointment of
God<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>.</p>

<p>This he gives as the Cause in general,
but argues that the same will hold for
those particularly believed to exist in this
Part of the World, as Hermaphrodites,
and those of a doubtful Sex<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>.</p>

<p>‘The same Reason that accounts for
the monstrous Births of Men with us,
may serve to account also for those of Nations
that are so; for God the Creator<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
of all, knew when and where every
thing should be created.’</p>

<p>As yet we know not of any Nation
or Genus of Men heterogeneous to
us in their Form, tho’ some<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> have wrote
concerning such; but later Progresses and
Discoveries round the World, shew us
to the contrary; if such a Nation was
to be found, we might indeed with
some Reason, suppose them to be a Race,
created on Purpose by God; but we
must not therefore assent to the Saint,
in imagining God to be the immediate
Author of any Form in those poor
Children (commonly call’d monstrous)
that might be painful or disadvantageous
to their well-being and Preservation;
and therefore his Comparison is not
justly laid down, because, tho’ the first
Semina of any Species of Animals are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
planted by the Ordination of the Almighty,
in an absolute Manner in the
Beginning, from which they cannot
digress in their successive Generations;
yet a Woman, possessing all the greatest
Beauties and Proportion in an hereditary
Succession, may bring forth a Child,
deformed in every Member; which can
reasonably be accounted no other than
one accidentally injured in the Uterus.</p>

<p>A Word or two more of this great
Man may be necessary here, to shew
that amongst those monstrous Births we
have enumerated from him, he was not
less certain of the Existence of Hermaphrodites,
than of any other, which
appears in these Words<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<p>‘Altho’ the Androgyni, which are
also call’d Hermaphrodites, are not
often, yet, no doubt, they sometimes
are, found, in whom the two Sexes
are so apparent, that it is uncertain
from which they should be named;
however the Custom of speaking has
prevail’d that they should be nominated
after the superior Sex, which is
the masculine, for no Body has ever said
Androgynecas or Hermaphroditas.’</p>

<p>These amount to the Majority of the
physical Causes, commonly assign’d for
the Growth of Hermaphrodites; many
more as unreasonable as these might be
drawn from the Opinions of Astronomers<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>,
who have endeavour’d to account
for such Births, by the Motions
of certain planetary Bodies, that, they
think, influence the Actions of Generation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
in a particular Manner, and produce
Variety of Monsters; but what are already
laid down, are fully sufficient to
demonstrate the Errors that reign thro’
the whole; and that the Existence of
Hermaphrodites being once granted
amongst them, the greater the Number
of Authors that strove to shew the Causes
of their Generation, the greater the Distance
to which Truth was banished on
this Occasion.</p>

<p><i>A general View of other Authors
concerning Hermaphrodites.</i></p>

</div>

<p>It is observable, that when Authors
are fond of having their Readers believe
what they assert, they generally
favour their own Opinions either in Descriptions
or Figures, so much as even
to stretch from the Truth of the Subject;
which so far answers their Ends as to beget
in some People, indolently credulous,
a Belief of what they see, and leads
them into an Error. This will appear,
by the following Animadversions
upon such Authors as I thought would
further answer our Intentions on the
present Occasion.</p>

<h3><i>Of <span class="gesperrt">MANARDUS</span>.</i></h3>

<p>It is not much to be wondered at,
that the Name Hermaphrodite should be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
so profusely made use of as it is among
Men, when we find an Author of no
small esteem giving the same Name, in a
general Way, to such as were even
troubled with several Kinds of Disorders
in the Pudenda, besides a supposed Existence
of both Sexes in the same Person;
for <i>Manardus</i><a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> in a Letter to one
<i>Michael Sactanna</i>, a Surgeon, sends him
a List of the Diseases incident to the exterior
Parts of the Body, with a short
Definition of each, and speaking of such
as he calls <i>utrique Sexui communes</i> has
these Words<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<p>‘Hermaphrodites are so call’d by both
<i>Greeks</i> and <i>Latins</i>, of which there are
three Kinds in Men, one in Women.
In Men the Similitude of the Parts of
Generation of a Woman is sometimes
in the Scrotum; sometimes it appears
in the Perinæum; and sometimes Urine
passes out by the Middle of the Scrotum.</p>

<p>‘In Women, above the Pudenda, by
the Pubis, the Form of the Parts of a
Man is prominent.’</p>

<p>It is very reasonable to imagine from
this Passage, that the Author cannot, by
what he has here laid down, signify an
hermaphrodital Nature in a strict Sense,
in any Person; because, according to our
Definition in the Beginning, there should
be both Sexes amply subsisting in the
same Body, whereas here he says, in
Men there are three Kinds of them; in
Women, one; and therefore if Men or
Women, how can they be Hermaphrodites?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
However, as to the first difference
in Men, where he says, ‘the Similitude
of a Woman’s Parts is sometimes in
the Scrotum.’—The first Notion we
can form of it is, that here is a Man
perfect in the Parts proper to him; besides
which the Likeness of the Parts of a Woman
in the Scrotum. Now whenever
any thing like a Fissure appears in this
Manner, I am inclined to believe it is
the divided Scrotum of certain Authors,
which are no other than the <i>Labia Muliebria</i>
with the Clitoris over them, being
equally protuberant to the lowermost
Part of the Orificium Vaginæ.</p>

<p>The Second is the perfect Man still
supposed, and the Likeness of the Pudenda
Muliebria in the Perinæum. This
amounts to the same thing as the former,
only the Thickness of the Labia reaches
not down so far as the Fissura Magna is
continued; and therefore he supposes,
that beneath the said Protuberance, the
rest of the Chink is the Perinæum<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<p>The third Division in Men is, only
the Urine issuing out of the Middle of
the Scrotum. This may indeed be
sometimes the Case in Men; for when
the <i>Glans Penis</i> is not perforated, or is
by any Disease closed up, Nature often
finds a Passage for the Urine in many
Places; of which we have several Cases
both from credible Authors, and also
from several eminent Practitioners in
Surgery who often meet such Cases. But
with what Right this may be call’d an
hermaphrodital Affair, I cannot imagine,
and shall therefore submit it to the Judgment
of the Reader. From these Considerations,
it is plain that the two former
of these Divisions are the very same
with that State of Hermaphroditism, that
the Author allows to Women, in the
same Paragraph, ‘in Women, above the
Pudenda, by the Pubis, the Form of the
Parts of a Man is prominent.’—Now,
since he allows, first they are Women and
have their natural Pudenda, whatsoever juts
out near the Pubis can be nothing but the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
Clitoris, for he does not take upon him
to say, that a <i>Penis</i> and <i>Scrotum</i> appear,
but the Form of them. Therefore
Forma Penis is the Clitoris; and the
Forma Scroti the Labia.</p>

<p>Here is an Author who makes a flourishing
Division of the Word, and applies
it to Cases not at all bearing the least
Proportion or Propriety to the Nature or
Sense of it; but rather alienates and
disguises it, by endeavouring to appear to
his Friend the more nice upon the Subject;
but however, from what has been
said of him, his Division seems to favour
rather of Pedantry than Judgment.</p>

<h3><i>Of <span class="gesperrt">RUEFFE</span>.</i></h3>

<p>Another Author worthy of Note here,
and from whom we may gather something
towards arriving at the Truth, is
<i>Jacobus Rueffe</i>, who gives an Account of
a Child which he calls an Hermaphrodite
as follows<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span></p>

<p>‘In the Year 1519, an Hermaphrodite
or Androgynus was born at
<i>Zurich</i>, well form’d from the Navel
upwards, but having that part cover’d
with a reddish fleshy Mass, beneath
which were the Female Parts, and
under these, those of a Man, in their
proper Situation.’<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>Let us here observe, that this Author
places the feminine Parts above the Masculine,
which he owns, and by his Figure
appear, to be in their proper Place.
Now every Anatomist will with Reason
admire at the Situation of the <i>Rima
Magna</i> above the Os Pubis, because in
order to have it so, the Vagina must have a
Way thro’ the Peritonæum, and the Fundus
Uteri must have a transverse Direction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
in a Right-line from the Labia
Externa, cutting the Body of the Child
’cross at Right-angles; this being the case,
it will be a difficult Matter to find a
Place for the Vesica Urinaria, from which
the Urethra ought to pass thro’ the Penis,
as that appears by the Figure to be the
most perfect. I confess the Singularity
of the Situation of the Female Parts
above the Penis and Scrotum renders me
an Infidel to the Story, from the known
impossibility of such a Structure. So
that if such a Subject was seen, I am
inclin’d to believe, that what he took
for the Vulva, and would have us believe
so, was no more than some particular
Mark or Rima in the Skin, such
things being not uncommon; and we
need no more wonder at the Author’s
being fond of making it what he does,
than at others, and not a few, who
would turn the Clitoris into a <i>Penis Virilis</i>,
or whimsically turn Boys into
Girls, and Girls into Boys, and therefore
as he does not say, whether himself
had seen it, or whether it was communicated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
to him, we must conjecture,
that when a thing is received by hear-say,
it is an easy Matter to make a Figure
answerable to the Report, and place
Parts of Bodies in the Situation that best
suits our Story<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>; we shall find this to be
pretty near the Case, when we come to
take notice of <i>Ambrose Paræy</i> underneath.</p>

<p>In the same Chapter this Author says,
that many Children are born, and even
grow to considerable Ages, whose Sex
is hardly upon Inspection to be distinguish’d.
The ignorant (says he) believe
them to consist of both, but are much
mistaken; then he pretends to have seen
one of these doubtful Cases in these
Words<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span></p>

<p>‘I happen’d to see such an Infant,
whose Sex was hard to be determined;
Testicles were indeed prominent without
a Penis; under the Testicles there
was a Rupture or Passage for the
Urine, but because of the want of
the Penis (nor was it totally absent,
but turn’d inwards and bending downwards
to the said Rupture) Nature
found this Way for the Exit of the
Urine. It was not baptized as a Female,
nor an Androgynus, but a Male
only.’</p>

<p>Here our Author needed not, in this
Example of Ambiguity, to be at a
stand with regard to the Sex, for from
his own account, the Child was Male,
since the Testiculi were conspicuous,
tho’ the Penis might not have been
protruded; and where these are in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
natural State, there cannot be (as is before
amply proved) any Part proper to
a Female in the same individual Body.
As to the Passage that nature found for
discharging the Urine, this could never
have been a sufficient Reason for the
doubt he seems to lie under, of the Sex,
because there is so wide a Difference between
such preter-natural Foraminulæ
and the Pudenda Muliebria. He hints,
that Nature was so kind to make that
Passage on account of the want of
the Penis, and yet is so loth to lose
it quite, as to affirm that the Penis
was not entirely wanting, but that it
turn’d inward, and was carry’d down to
the little Aperture under the Scrotum.
This is a very odd kind of Structure,
and in order to give Credit to our Author,
we must first suppose such another Reflection
of the Penis (first to be carried
up before the Os Pubis, and then turn’d
down again between that and the Scrotum
to open under it) as that of the Aspera
Arteria in the Sternum of the wild
Swan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p>I cannot devise by what Means Credit
should be given to such Narrations as
these, which so far digress from human
Nature’s Laws, when not accompanied
with a very nice and particular anatomick
Description of such Parts; and
even that attested by Numbers of Persons
equally skill’d in the same Science,
or a publick Society of learned Men,
whose Delight it is to enquire after
Truth and rectify superstitious Allegations
of all Kinds, especially in natural
History. At last this Author, after informing
us that the Child was received
and baptiz’d by the People as a Male,
and not a Female nor Hermaphrodite,
concludes the Paragraph thus<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>: ‘But
because such Subjects are better perceiv’d
by the Understanding, than by Sight; I
was not willing to represent it by any particular
Figure.’ He was very much in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
the Right not to give a Figure of this
Subject from his Imagination only, which,
I am sure, he as well as several other
Authors have done before, without any
other Authority than the Tradition of
the People.’</p>

<h3><i>REALD. COLUMBUS.</i></h3>

<p>This Author<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> must not want a Place
amongst the rest, who after he has given
an account of the Dissection, mention’d
in the Conclusion of this Treatise, proceeds
to relate his Observations upon
two Persons which he calls a Male Hermaphrodite,
and a Female one; his
Words are,<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> ‘I have moreover consider’d
two living Hermaphrodites,
one whereof was Male the other Female.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p>He gives the Story of what he calls
the Woman Hermaphrodite first, which
is much of a Piece with that of the other
Authors mention’d hereafter. But if he
had said at once, that he had consider’d
the Cases of a Man and Woman, he
would have appear’d a more judicious
Historian, than he seems to be by adding
the Word Hermaphrodite to either;
which will be evident by the Sequel of
his Account, <i>viz.</i><a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<p>‘There was one of those <i>Æthiopian</i>
Women, called, by the <i>Lombardians</i>,
Cingaræ, who could neither perform
as a Man nor Woman, for she unfortunately
had both Sexes imperfect;
the Penis not exceeding the Size of
one’s little Finger, in length or thickness,
and the Hole of the Vulva was
so narrow as not to be capable of receiving
the Top of the little Finger.
This Wretch intreated me to cut off
the Penis, which she said, would be
a Hinderance to her in the Coitus,
and also desir’d I would enlarge the
Vulva, that she might be capable of
receiving a Man; but I dared not
grant her Request; knowing the Danger
the Vessels were liable to, therefore
thought it could not be done without
hazarding her life.’</p>

<p>There is not the least room to hesitate
upon this Case, with regard to the
hermaphrodital Character he gives her;
for it is plain from her own desire, nothing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
but the Properties of a Female were
in her. If otherwise, she would never
have begg’d him to cut off the Part which
our Author calls a Penis, but in truth
the Clitoris; and from her earnest Entreaty
to have her Femine Parts dilated
and made capable of receiving the necessary
Part of the contrary Sex; for it is commonly
the Case in such Women as have
the Clitoris longer than ordinary, to have
the Orifice more or less, covered with a
thin<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Skin arising from the Perinæum;
this must have been the Case with her,
and the Author might have gratified her
by a Chirurgical Excision of that Part, as
safely as the <i>Ethiopians</i> and <i>Egyptians</i>
perform the same upon their own Children.
And as to the membranous Covering
to the Orifice of the Vagina, it
might have been remedied by a Snip<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
of a Scissars. That part in the Angolan
is near half covered with the same;
and not many Days ago, a Child of
about eight Years old, had it almost entirely
covered, which was cured in the
same easy Manner.</p>

<p>But to our Author’s Man Hermaphrodite<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>:</p>

<p>‘I made Observations on a living Man
Hermaphrodite, who appeared as follows;
He had a Penis and Scrotum
with Testes, under which, in the Perinæum
(that is, between the Testicles
and the Anus) where the Section is
made for the Extraction of the Stone
of the Bladder, there was a Hole in
the Manner of a Vulva, but was not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
deep; and these are all the Hermaphrodites
I have met with.’</p>

<p>What an Infatuation it looks like in
Men, that so little Regard should be had
either to the Nature of the Subject related,
or even to the very Terms made
use of to express the thing they would
exhibit. This is plain in our Author,
and indeed I cannot but think it a great
deal more necessary than is commonly
imagined, that the Choice of Terms
should be well concerted, and adapted
to any Subject with the utmost care;
because a small Difference in a Word
makes a great Variation in the Idea that
should be proportioned to the thing
treated of; and hence, much better
Terms than that of Hermaphrodite might
be drawn from the Diseases of either of
the Subjects our Author writes of.</p>

<p>What could here make him suppose
this Man to be an Hermaphrodite, when
such palpable Marks of the Male Sex
only were in his View, and not the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
least Sign of a Female? The following
Author <i>Parée</i> was infected with this Notion
of <i>Columbus</i>, concerning the Slit in
the Perinæum; which see more particularly
taken Notice of under that Author.</p>

<h3><i>Of <span class="gesperrt">AMBROSE PARÉE</span>.</i></h3>

<p>We have no more from this Author
than the Sentiments of some of the Ancients
concerning the Nature and Causes
of Hermaphrodites, and therefore by his
copying and assenting to them we may
easily guess at what he thought of the
Matter; however, in order to do him all
the Justice imaginable, let us draw out
such of his Words as are suitable to our
present Purpose, and take a short View
of them, by which we shall find as
much will occur towards forwarding our
Attempt, from an Examination of him,
as from that of any other Author<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span></p>

<p>‘Hermaphrodites or Androgyni are
Children born with a double genital
Member, one Masculine the other Femine,
and are therefore call’d in our
Language Men and Women.’</p>

<p>This Definition appears very absolute
with regard to the Existence of the
Members of both Sexes in one Body,
which our Author easily grants, because
<i>Aristotle</i> and others after him has said it;
but by considering his Division of Hermaphrodites
in the next Sentence, and the
Causes he assigns for them, we shall find
his Account, and the Figures he has
given us of them, to be partly copy’d
and partly fictitious; here are then his
Words faithfully taken from an Edition
of his Works printed at <i>Lyons</i> in
the Year <span class="smcap">M.dc.xli</span><a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span></p>

<p>‘As to the Cause of Hermaphrodites,
it is because the Woman affords as
much seminal Matter as the Man, and
because the forming Faculty always endeavours
the Formation of things alike,
that is from the Male Part of the Matrix
a Male, and from the Feminine
Part a Female; which is the Reason
why two Sexes are found in one Body,
call’d Hermaphrodites.’</p>

<p>It is of no inconsiderable use, upon
examining any Subject, to observe
particularly the Hypotheses upon which
Authors seem to build Arguments for
supporting what they publish to the
World; because whether they follow
the Sentiments of others or no, if any
Absurdities should arise from such Reasonings,
the Truth must still be remote,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
which is in its own Nature so clear as
to shine forth without much Strife,
when Arguments are founded upon
Facts fairly stated. Let us therefore
take notice of our Author professing,
according to the Ancient Notions of Generation
already hinted at, that an Hermaphrodite
is produc’d from an equal
Quantity of the Semina of both Male
and Female, elaborated together with
equal Force; which by virtue of the
Vis Formatrix, or Vis Plastica, (the
Author’s <i>Vertue Formatrice</i>) which he
says, endeavouring always to form things
alike, is the Reason why two Sexes are
form’d in the same Body.</p>

<p>The present Notions of Generation are
greatly different from what is here the
Faith of our Author, because a better
Knowledge of the Structure of the Parts,
which are the Instruments of it, has
taken Place; and certainly an Hypothesis
is better founded upon an experimental
Fact, than upon bare Supposition;
for the Ancients, who knew nothing of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
the Uses of Ovaria, nor Fallopian Tubes,
had no other Way of accounting for
Generation, but this of our Author,
which they suppos’d from only being
sensible of an Injection of something in
the Coitus from the Male, and again,
from believing something to exist in the
Female, which they also called Semen,
the natural Conclusion that arose from
this Consideration was, that an admixtion
was made of both, and in order to complete
the Work, that occult Finisher,
‘the Vis Formatrix,’ was summoned to
assist till the Fœtus was moulded out.
The most illiterate Grooms have the
same Opinion ’till this Day (tho’ they
never knew it was said by any Author)
drawn from the same natural Reason
only; for I have taken notice of one
thing they do instantly after a breeding
Mare is cover’d by a Horse; which is
to throw a large Quantity of Water, that
is always prepar’d for that Purpose, about
her back Parts, which they say
is done in order to make her cringe,
and keep what she has received. And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
I have further observ’d, that when any
Part of it has been rejected, immediately
after the Coitus, by the Mare,
they have despaired of any Benefit from
the Access of the Horse. Hence it is
plain that the Causes assign’d by our
Author for the Production of this double
nature in human Bodies, can produce
no such Effect; for the World is by this
time assur’d, that the Mechanism of Generation
is otherwise carry’d on, and
that no animal Being whatsoever is generated
in the Manner laid down by our
Author and his Predecessors, therefore
no Hermaphrodite can be the Effect of
such a Scheme of Generation. But now
to his Division<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span></p>

<p>‘Of which there are four Divisions,
to wit, Male Hermaphrodites, who
have the Male Sex perfect, and can
engender properly, and have a Hole like
the Vulva in the Perinæum, not at all
penetrating into the Body, from which
neither Urine nor Semen passes.’</p>

<p>This Division of Hermaphrodites differs
in some measure from that of <i>Manardus</i>
and <i>Laurentius</i>, but is of as little
account as either. This first Part of it
declares a perfect Male, which he owns
to be capable of Procreation; and because
he finds (or supposes) an accidental
Mark like a Slit or Hole in the Perinæum,
he makes this Male an Hermaphrodite
in an instant, though at
the same time he confesses the Hole
to be always superficial, as not at
all penetrating into any Part of the
Body, and that neither Urine nor Seed
can pass thro’ it. If it should happen
to a Man to have an accidental Wound
near the Privities, or to a Woman to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
have any kind of Wart, or Tumour
near hers, we might with as much
right account them Hermaphrodites,
as <i>Parée</i> does this Male Child with
the Slit in the Perinæum<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>. How therefore
can such a Hole or Slit which is
totally superficial, and can have no Manner
of use ascribed to it, entitle a Boy
to the Character above-mention’d? This
is writing for writing’s Sake; but to
proceed<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>.</p>

<p>‘The Woman Hermaphrodite, besides
the Vulva which is well formed,
and from which flows both Semen and
Menses, has a Penis Virilis, situated
above the said Vulva, near the Groin,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
without a Præputium; but having a
smooth Skin, which cannot be turned
back; without any Erection; from
which neither Semen nor Urine can
pass; and having no Sign of a Scrotum,
nor Testicles.’</p>

<p>This second Sort is what our Author
calls his female Hermaphrodite; in this
he owns the feminine Parts perfect and
capable of all the natural Functions and
Offices proper to them; but adds, that
they have over them what he calls a
Membre virile: It is very odd and preposterous
to account this Part a Penis virilis,
to which he does not allow a Præputium,
Power of Erection, a Passage
for the Discharge of Urine, nor the least
Sign of Scrotum nor Testes; his Opinion
is just indeed, when he calls this subject
a female; but when he tacks to it the
Word Hermaphrodite, and calls the Clitoris
a Membre virile, which should have
all the Properties he denies it, in order
to it’s being so accounted, his Notion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
seems as injudicious as it is useless. But
to his third Division<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>:</p>

<p>‘Hermaphrodites, which are neither
the one Sex nor the other, are altogether
excluded and exempt from the
Power of generating, their Sexes being
quite imperfect; and situated beside
one another, and sometimes one above
the other, serving for no other Use
than for the Discharge of Urine.’</p>

<p>In the two foregoing Divisions, this
Author’s Fondness of calling Men and
Women, each perfect in their Sex, Hermaphrodites,
is very culpable; but in this
his forging a new Kind is inexcusable; for
he has put two Figures in his Book to
explain this Division; the first of which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
is that of a single Body, with the Vulva
on the Right Side, and the Penis and
Scrotum on the Left, close to each other,
over which he has this Inscription<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>:
‘The Figure of an Hermaphrodite, Man
and Woman.’ And yet in this Division
he describes the same Kind, and
calls it<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> ‘neither one nor t’other:’ declares
them incapable of Generation, and
that their Parts serve for no other Use
than for the Discharge of Urine; but
leaves us in the Dark as to which of the
Parts, or whether both, serve to this Use.
Now as by the Inscription over this Figure
he intends to demonstrate both Male
and Female, which is his fourth Division;
and by his third Division, he describes
the same Figure to be neither the
one nor the other; it is no difficult Matter
to perceive this Figure is purely invented
to illustrate what an Hermaphrodite
is in general, according to the Idea<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
he himself had formed of it. The second
is a Figure of two Children sticking
together by the Backs, to both which
he puts the same Marks of the Parts of
Generation as to the former, as if both
Children were Hermaphrodites; and, indeed,
he might have as well placed the
Parts of fifty to the same Body, as to
have been guilty of what appears to have
been his common way of proceeding, for
he feigns or borrows Figures to serve
every Occasion; this clearly appears by
comparing this Author’s Figures with
those of <i>Jac. Rueffe</i>; for he makes one
of the Figures of that Author serve to
illustrate two different Stories; he tells of
Monsters with four Hands, and as many
Feet; but this, with several others of the
like Kind, may be the Subject of another
Place<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></p>

<p>‘Hermaphrodites, that are both Male
and Female, are such as have the two
Sexes perfectly formed, and capable of
Generation.’</p>

<p>As to this fourth Division he makes of
Hermaphrodites, which is allowing the
Parts of both Sexes Perfection, as well as
a Power of exercising either to the same
Person, I believe, from what has been
said, this, as well as the others before,
may be set at nought; however, a Word
or two more concerning the Reasons and
Causes he assigns for Hermaphrodites will
further confute this Author. The Cause
he says is, as was before mentioned, an
Elaboration, or working together with
equal Force in all Respects, of the Semina
of both Male and Female, in the
Uterus, that produces the two Sexes in
one Body. Now since according to this
System several of the old Authors, from
whom he had this Opinion, held the
seminal Matter to be as absolutely necessary
to Generation in a Woman, as in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
Man; and as they were strongly of Opinion,
that a Kind of Paste was formed
of both together, to make a Fœtus compleat,
an equal Quantity on each Side
ought to produce the more perfect Child,
and not at all any thing monstrous, even
(I say) according to this very System,
held by them; and this agrees so well
with another Part of their Opinions in
general, (which is, that a Defect in the
Quantity of the seminal Matter on either
Side was the Cause of a Deficiency in
some Member or other of the Offspring)
that it is surprizing to find that Reason
assigned for a Cause of a monstrous Production,
which necessarily appears to be,
in their own way of arguing, a much
better one for the Formation of a perfect
Child.</p>

<h3><i>ANDREAS LAURENTIUS.</i></h3>

<p>In reading some foreign Authors, who
wrote large Pieces in Medicine<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>, it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
plainly appears, (as I have before hinted
very often) they did little else than copy
from one another, because probably as
they were ambitious of writing, and one
strove who should excel the other in the
Quantity more than the Merit of the
Work, so the Improvements that might
reasonably be expected from succeeding
Writers lay neglected: Whereas if that
beneficial Method, so much the Practice
of our own Authors, was but prosecuted
by some of those Foreigners, of handling
and considering any one particular Part
of the Science, they might have had
Time to be somewhat more accurate and
instructive. Our Author seems to be of
that Set, who thought so well of the
Division of <i>Manardus</i>, concerning the
Doctrine of Hermaphrodites, that he
was content to write the same Thing
with that Author, with very little Variation.
And as we have considered
him already, the less of this present
Author will serve, and that only a
comparative View of both, which, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
hope, will be found necessary in this
Place<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>:</p>

<p>‘Such as have two Natures are called
Hermaphrodites; in Men it happens
three different Ways; when there appears
a small Vulva in the Perinæum;
again in the Scrotum, but without any
Discharge of Excrements, and the same
with a Discharge of Urine; in Women
one Kind; when a Penis is prominent
in the Place of the Clitoris, at
the lower Part of the Pubis.’</p>

<p>Now the Difference that we find between
these Authors is, that the <i>Muliebre
pudendum exiguum</i> of the former, is
the <i>Similitudo muliebris pudendi</i> of the
latter. And also our Author, instead of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
saying, with <i>Manardus, aliquando in Scroto</i>,
says <i>cum itidem in Scroto, sed nullo
excrementi profluvio</i>. This he adds in
order to make <i>Manardus</i>’s Division more
distinct; because that Author says, in
his third Division, <i>aliquando per medium
Scrotum Urina exit</i>, which is much the
same with <i>in Scroto</i>, only attended with
a Capacity of discharging Urine; and
therefore <i>Laurentius</i> calls his third Division,
<i>ibidem exeunte Lotio</i>. In the whole
Matter, this is the mere Doctrine of
<i>Manardus</i>, but in other Words. Now
though our Author has done with him,
he has a sneaking Kindness for <i>Rueffe</i>
and <i>Parée</i>, which is manifest in the
very next Line, which is thus<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>:</p>

<p>‘Some add, that above the Root of
the Penis the Parts of a Woman are
apparent.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span></p>

<p>This is expressed by <i>Rueffe</i> in his Description
of the Child with the fleshy
Substance about the Navel, as is before-mentioned
under his Name. Again<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>:</p>

<p>‘In Women, when the Penis is situated
either in the Groin or Perinæum.’</p>

<p>As to the Penis in the Groin, he has
taken that Hint from those Figures of
<i>Parée</i>, which are before clearly proved
to be fictitious; but because I have not
taken notice of any mention, in any Author,
of the Existence of a Penis in the
Perinæum, I am inclined to believe this
Part of the System to be of <i>Laurentius</i>’s
own coining, and refer it to the Judges
in Anatomy whether any such Structure
can be blended with human Nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span></p>

<h3><i>JOHANNES RIOLANUS.</i></h3>

<p>It is very observable, that several Authors,
in treating of this Subject, notwithstanding
they run into such flourishing
Divisions of the Word Hermaphrodite,
yet are commonly sure, before they
conclude, to disown, or, in a great Measure,
contradict those very Assertions
which, for Art’s Sake, they at first ventured
on. This shines in our present
Author, who, after he has described the
Parts of Generation, proceeds to recount
the Diseases of them which he calls his
<i>Consideratio Medica</i><a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>; and under that
Head<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>, amongst the Diseases of the
Urethra, he brings in some Species of
Hermaphrodites, as though none were
entitled to that Character but such as
had Disorders in those Parts proper to
Men; but from what he says of them,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
nothing can occur to any reasonable Person
but a Notion of the real Diseases of
the Parts, however he came to call them
Hermaphrodites, which Name is applied
here with as much Impropriety as with
any other Author whatsoever. His
Words are<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>:</p>

<p>‘Hermaphrodites belong to the Urethra
and Scrotum, if the Testicles
should be hid in the Peritonæum, and
the Scrotum empty; or opened in the
middle from a Perforation in the Urethra;
when the Sides of the Scrotum
are like the Labia of the Pudenda of
Women, and the Penis also very little;
these Things have deceived ignorant
Midwives, who often think such Children
females at their Birth.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span></p>

<p>Now it is plain, that tho’ he brings
these Accidents and Diseases under that
Denomination, which (as he was Professor)
must have been only by way of
School-Method, yet his Conclusion of
this Paragraph shews that his Opinion
was, that the Testes remaining hid in
the Peritonæum, and the Scrotum empty
with an Aperture in the middle, the
Penis being extreamly small, were all
Accidents that happened to the Male
Sex, though judged to be Females by
the Ignorance of Midwives, at the Time
of their Birth; and, indeed, though the
Testes may be not as yet come down,
nothing can be conceived of such a Subject
but the true Male Sex; but if the
Sides of the Scrotum look like Labia, it
must be a female Case with a prominent
Clitoris, for it is absurd to think the
Scrotum can be divided, as we have
proved above. Again, this Author, after
taking notice of some other Diseases of
the Urethra of Males, and their Scrota,
utterly denies that Females can be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
changed into the other Sex, but that
Children reputed Females from some of
the forementioned Disorders, have always
proved to be Males in the End<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>.</p>

<p>‘Such Subjects, after being thought
Females, have at length proved Males,
for no Woman was ever changed to a
Man; but might be misjudged by the
Length of the Clitoris, or an Hypersarcosis,
arising from the Uterus, which
might be in some Measure like a Penis
in Form and Hardness, but not at all
in the Composition or Structure, <i>&amp;c.</i>’</p>

<p>In this Paragraph he is very particular
upon the Reports of a Change of Sex,
and adds, to the two former, these two
other Ways of the Vulgar’s being deceived<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
with respect to such Changes; as
if he had said, ‘I know of no other
way for changing a Woman into a
Man, except you’ll have it that a long
Clitoris, or an Hypersarchosis, growing
out of the Vagina makes a Man.’—This
he confirms again in his thirty-sixth
Chapter of the same Book under his
Medical Considerations on the feminine
Parts of Generation, under the Head of
<i>Morbi Peculiares</i>, where when he comes
to the Clitoris he says<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>:</p>

<p>‘The Clitoris sometimes grows inordinately
long, and counterfeits a Penis;
it is called a Tail with which Women
abuse one another; these are called<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
Hermaphrodites, or Fricatrices, nor
was it ever known, and it is impossible,
that a Woman should be transformed
into a Man. But a Male Child
at it’s Birth being thought a Female,
as was said before, when his Parts begin
to come out which lay hid, may,
indeed, become a Man.’</p>

<p>Hence it is plain, that our Author
would make Use of the Word Hermaphrodite,
not as crediting such an Existence,
as it expresses, in human Nature;
but as thinking it a Term fit only
to serve him in his Explication of some
of the Diseases of the Parts of Generation.</p>

<h3><i>REGNERUS DE GRAAF.</i></h3>

<p>This Author, in his particular Description
of the Clitoris, gives a History
of a Child born with that Part so large,
that all who saw it pronounced it a
Male Child; and it was accordingly baptized
as such, and securely allowed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
be a Boy. However, <i>de Graaf</i> had no
such Opinion; for the Doubt that he,
and others of the Faculty of Physick
were in concerning this Child, caused a
more narrow Enquiry into it’s Nature,
which was favoured by it’s Death; and
the Result of their Examination is very
positively expressed by him thus<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>:</p>

<p>‘But an accurate Dissection of those
Parts after Death has detected the
Deceit, <i>&amp;c.</i>’</p>

<p>The History in full, with the Figure,
he gives in another Place<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>, of which
let us consider the following Particulars.</p>

<p>When this Child died, our worthy
Author, in Company with several Physicians
and Surgeons, first had a drawing
made of the exterior Appearance of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
Parts of Generation, and then proceeded
to open the Body, upon which they
found the Uterus, Ovaria, Tubes, and
spermatick Vessels according to the
Standard of Nature; but seeing no Scrotum,
they searched in the Groins and
elsewhere for Testes but in vain; for
neither these nor any other Signs of a
Masculine Nature could be found. Then
they proceeded to examine whether there
was any Passage in the Clitoris, but were
foiled in this also; but found the Urethra
under it in the proper Place as in
all Females, through which they passed
an Instrument into the Bladder. Afterwards
they inflated this Part (first stopping
the Orifice of the Vagina) which
when it was very much distended, they
compressed greatly to see if any Air could
pass out by the Clitoris, but this likewise
was to no Purpose; at length they
cut the Clitoris across, but found not
the least Sign of an Urethra, nor any
other Thing but what is proper to that
Part. From whence he concludes, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
though it resembled a Penis virilis in all
Respects,<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> ‘Yet we pronounced it not
a Penis, but the proper Part of a Female,
known by the Name of a Clitoris.’</p>

<p>Here is a Series of strong Experiments
upon this Child, to prove very sufficiently
that these Kind of Subjects are only
Female, after it was received as a Male
by all that saw it; and yet this great
Man’s Figure of the Thing must have
inevitably produced a greater Notion, in
us, of the Predominancy of the Masculine
Sex, than of the other, if the
above History and his judicious Explanation
were not annexed to it; only
because he had asserted it was like the
<i>Virga virilis</i>, and therefore had it drawn
in a Position that favoured that Assertion,
and gave the whole as much of
the Mien of that Sex as possible; for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
though he denies (in his Description)
any Perforation to the Clitoris, yet in
the Drawing it appears to have one at
the Extremity; so that this joined to the
close Position of the Labia under it,
which appear very protuberant (though
nothing was found in them) without the
least View of the vaginal Orifice, entirely
conceals the natural Sex, and actually
represents the contrary. Thus we
may easily see how necessary, and of
what Consequence it is towards the Exhibition
of Truth, to dispose of any
Subject in a natural impartial Attitude or
Light, either for describing or drawing,
because no other Idea could be conceived
of our Author’s Figure but what I have
expressed above; whereas if he had
either drawn it with the Labia open, or
made a second Figure to represent the
inferior Part next the Anus, looking upwards
at it, so that the Nymphæ might
come in view, it would have been more
analogous to so just a Description as he
has exhibited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span></p>

<h3><i>Of <span class="gesperrt">DIEMERBROECK</span>.</i></h3>

<p>To examine this Author, concerning
his Opinion of Hermaphrodites, will be
extreamly worth while; for we shall find
him making the strongest Efforts to persuade
the World, that a seminal Matter
issues from the Clitoris, and making a
great many Shifts to prove it, as if he
had a Mind to introduce a Notion of a
Power of ejecting a seminal Juice, from
that Part in those Confricatrices, and
thereby to render them equally capable
of the Coitus in the Quality of either
Sex: But how strange an Appearance
does it make, to find him, in the end,
giving Histories of several of these reputed
Hermaphrodites, with some Animadversions
on them, which serve to overturn
and confute what he has taken no
small Pains to maintain before.</p>

<p>This Author asserts, that the<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Semen
is brought partly from the Testes and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
Tubes by the Ligamenta Rotunda (which
he calls Vessels, and adds, that heretofore
they were improperly called Ligaments)
and so emitted by the Glans;
but how a Communication is carried on
between these Ligaments and the Clitoris
he has not given us the least Account;
yet he persists very strenuously in that Opinion,
tho’ he owns at the same Time,
that upon the Dissection of these Parts
no convenient Passage appears for such
an Emission, and this turns him upon
another Method of accounting for it,
which is, that the Pores of the Glans
are so distended by Heat, Agitation, <i>&amp;c.</i>
that Semen may easily pass forth. He
backs this Opinion with a Story he tells,
of a Patient that complained to him of
an involuntary Emission from that Part,
occasioned by her too frequent provoking
it before; part of the Words of this
History may not be amiss, in this Place,
for the Reader’s Satisfaction<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span></p>

<p>‘Lately a Woman of no little Credit
complained to me, that in her younger
Days, having early Desires, she often
rubbed that Part (the Clitoris) with her
Finger, so as to provoke the Emission
of Semen with much Delight, and
that in some time this ill Custom caused
it to become a Disease.’</p>

<p>Here he makes a Passage through the
Ligamenta Rotunda for Semen to come
to the Clitoris, in order to make a close
Analogy between the Penis and that
Part; and, finding no Urethra, makes it
pass out by the Pores of the Glans, and
by way of Confirmation of his Opinion,
tells the above Story from the
Mouth of the Woman herself, believes
her, and would have the World give
Credit to it also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<p>In another Place<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> he absolutely confesses,
no Passage like an Urethra has hitherto
been found upon Dissections in
that Part; yet Reason (says he) tells me
there must be one, though in dead Bodies
it disappears; otherwise I demand
by what Passage can such a Discharge
proceed from these Confricatrices and
Hermaphrodites. His Words are, ‘Mulieres
Confricatrices atque etiam Hermaphroditi.’
As if these two Characters
signified different Things, which in
other Authors are esteemed the same.
This is rivetting his Opinion of an Urethra,
though none can be found, and
totally omitting to make any more Use
of his Argument of the Pores, whether
wilfully, as believing it a weak one, or
through Forgetfulness, we cannot say;
but his subsequent Histories will shew,
how he tumbles from this Notion into a
direct Contradiction of a pervious Clitoris;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
and as to his Pretence of the Ligamenta
Rotunda’s being Vessels, every Anatomist
is able to make a Judgment; and also of
what Use it is to have a Discharge from
the Clitoris, those in any wise acquainted
with the Nature of Generation, and the
Structure of the Parts, will easily refute.</p>

<p>Now we shall proceed to take notice
of some of the Histories he gives concerning
enlarged Clitorides in Women,
which he takes from several Authors,
and introduces in these Words<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>:</p>

<p>‘In Hermaphrodites this is the Part
which, as it grows, resembles the Penis;
this is plain, because no Perforation
can be discerned in it.’</p>

<p>This Sentence very much weakens his
guess’d Opinion of the Urethra, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
he does very often afterwards in his several
Stories of these Creatures. The
first he saw was in <i>France</i>, of about
Twenty-eight Years of Age, which was
shewed to the People for Money; he
describes her thus<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>:</p>

<p>‘This Subject, on the upper Part of
the Pudenda, had a Clitoris as long as
one’s Finger, and as thick as a Penis;
with a Glans, Frenulum, and Præputium,
as are seen in Men, except that
the Glans was not pervious; below
this there was an urinary Passage, and
the Vagina Uteri as in Women; in
each Labium there was a Testicle.’</p>

<p>In this History our Author owns, there
was no Perforation to be seen in this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
large Clitoris; and as to the other Parts he
describes no more than a perfect Woman.</p>

<p>Another of these he saw at <i>Utrecht</i>,
which her Owner told him was a perfect
Female till between five and six
Years old; at which Time she began to
change, and at Eleven a Penis was
grown conspicuous, but without a Perforation:
the said Man told him also,
that she had then her Menses periodically
as other Women. She had below
the Clitoris the Meatus Urinarius and
Vagina properly situated, to which he
adds a Testis in each Labium; and further,
that there was a seminal Discharge
upon Occasion, but that the Hermaphrodite
did not know whether it was
by the Clitoris, or the other feminine
Parts. His Narration of this History
begins thus, of which we shall insert but
a few Words, the Substance being just
mentioned above<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span></p>

<p>‘In Company with other Spectators,
I have seen such another <i>English</i> Hermaphrodite,
twenty-two Years old,
here at <i>Utrecht, &amp;c.</i>’</p>

<p>This is the Subject Dr <i>Allen</i> speaks of
in the <i>Transactions</i>, which has been
taken notice of before in this Treatise,
that was carried to <i>Flanders</i>, and shewed
to our Author; now whosoever will be
at the Pains to compare the Descriptions
given by both these Authors, which they
had only from the Mouth of her Keeper,
will see how they differ, and consequently
what Untruths proceed from
Hearsay; now after all these Things,
our Author makes this Conclusion of his
own Accord<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>:</p>

<p>‘From all which it is plain, that
these Kind of Hermaphrodites do not
partake of both Sexes, but are only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
Women, whose Parts of Generation
are illy formed, that is, the Testes
have descended out of the Abdomen,
and the Clitoris is grown too large.’</p>

<p>It would have been much more to
the Credit of this Author to have subscribed
to this Doctrine at once, without
endeavouring to maintain, in so uncertain
a Manner, any Thing that had
the least Hint towards allowing a Perforation
in the Clitoris, or a virile Nature
to a Woman, and so suddenly to quit
and contradict his former Opinion, in
his Histories and Animadversions on
them, which must be very obvious to
any one that will allow himself Time
and Liberty to consider the Animal Oeconomy,
and the Laws of Nature, as
far as they respect human Bodies.</p>

<h3><i>Dr <span class="gesperrt">DOUGLAS</span>.</i></h3>

<p>The Explanation of the Figures in
the following large Plate, which this
most consummate Anatomist has favoured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
me with, are sufficient to shew, that
these Sort of Subjects are, in his Opinion,
Females in all Respects. The
first Figure he had delineated from the
<i>Angolan</i> in a most accurate Manner; and
the other two were done some time ago,
as appears by his Explanation; of both
which he had given Copies to the ingenious
Mr <i>Cheselden</i>, which he has in his
Book of Anatomy.</p>

<p>In making these Figures, the Doctor,
according to his accustomed Accuracy,
avoids the Omission which <i>De Graaf</i> is
guilty of; for though the latter’s Dissection
and Description of the Subject that
came before him are very satisfactory, in
proving it Female, yet inasmuch as he
has not shewed any Part of the Orificium
Vaginæ in his Figure, it is not so much
to the Purpose as those of Dr <i>Douglas</i>.</p>

<p>This Woman was carried from <i>Angola</i>
in <i>Africa</i>, amongst other Slaves, to
<i>America</i>, from whence she was brought
to <i>Bristol</i>. She is about six and twenty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
Years old, has no Beard on her Chin,
nor any Thing masculine in her Countenance;
her Arms above the Elbow are
thick and fleshy, as many Womens are,
but soft; her Breasts are small, her Voice
effeminate in the common Tone of
speaking, and it was reported she has
often been lain with by Men; and as to
the Parts of Generation, they are so justly
described in the following Explanation,
that the Reader is referred to
that.</p>

<p class="hanging">3. <i>Nympha Luxurians</i>, or as this Part is
commonly called, tho’ very improperly,
<i>Clytoris, magnitudine aucta</i>, that is,
the true <i>Nympha Muliebris</i>, which is
enlarged to an uncommon Length and
Bigness, in which we may observe it’s
<i>Cutis Rugosa</i>, or wrinkly Skin, which
terminates in a <i>Præputium</i>, here turned
back to shew it’s large <i>Glans</i>, in
which there is not the smallest Perforation
or Opening.</p>

<p class="hanging">4, 5. The Labia opened and turned
back, to shew the Entrance into the
Vagina; the Labium on the left Side
is of a natural Bigness for the Size of
the Woman; but the other Labium
is very large, in which is contained a
hard Substance, surrounded with something
soft to the touch, and which
may be traced as coming down from
the <i>Inguen</i>.</p>

<p>This Tumour, in my Opinion, is the
real <i>Ovarium</i> or Testicle of that Side prolapsed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
and fallen down from it’s natural
Place within the Abdomen, thro’
the Fissure in the Muscles belonging to
the last mentioned Part, into this Labium
where it is lodged, covered with
an Elongation in Form of a Bag or Sacculus
from the <i>Peritonæum</i>, in which it
lies enclosed together with the <i>Tuba Falloppii</i>,
the <i>Ligamentum uteri latum</i>, and
the Ligament that goes from the Testicle
to the <i>Uterus</i>, in the very same Manner
that the common <i>Hernia</i>’s, whether of
the Intestinum, the Omentum, or both,
are produced in Women.</p>

<p>My Reasons for this Conjecture (which
was long ago simply proposed by Professor<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
<i>Diemerbroeck</i>, but without any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
Manner of Proof to support it) shall be
given in a general Treatise of <i>Hernia</i>’s,
which I have very near finished, and, I
hope, will be published in a short Time;
the Ovaria, or <i>Testiculi Mulierum</i>, being
in the Number of those Parts that fall
down from their natural Situation, and
constitute that Disorder we call a Hernia
or Rupture.</p>

<p>In my Collection of the morbid uterine
Parts, I have two Preparations
where the Ovaria and Extremities of the
Tubæ Falloppianæ lie exactly on that
Part of the Peritonæum, under which
the <i>Ligamenta uteri teretia seu rotunda</i>
do pass out from within the Abdomen;
and the <i>Fundus Uteri</i>, instead of lying
backwards on the <i>Intestinum rectum</i> and
<i>os Sacrum</i>, is turned forwards, and lies
on the Os Pubis and Vesica. This, I
own, is only a conjectural Proof for the
present, a real one cannot be offered till
the Part itself, where the Tumour is,
can be examined by ocular Inspection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span></p>

<p>The Tumour marked 2, I take to be
the Ovarium on the other Side, just clear
of the abdominal Muscles, but not come
low enough for the Labium, but will
no doubt in Time, if not prevented by
some outward Compression. I am informed,
that the other Tumour came
down gradually.</p>

<p class="hanging">6, 7. The slender <i>Alæ</i> or <i>Pterygia vaginæ</i>,
improperly called <i>Nymphæ</i>. On
the upper Part of these cuticular Foldings,
the <i>Frenulum</i> 6, is observed to
be lost, that comes obliquely downwards
from the under Side of the
<i>Glans</i>.</p>

<p class="hanging">8. The Orificium, or Entrance into the
Vagina, with a smooth whitish Skin

Appearances may be in her, such
as the Largeness of the <i>Clitoris</i>, and
that Tumour in the <i>Labium</i>, that are
capable of raising other Opinions, they
may be deemed a morbid State in the
Accretion of the Parts; and as to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
said Tumour in the Labium, several of
the Learned are divided about it, and
their different Opinions amount to three,
<i>viz.</i></p>

<p>1. That such are Testes like those in
Men.</p>

<p>2. That they are Herniæ of the Ovaria.</p>

<p>3. That they are Glands of an indolent
Nature, void of any Use, fallen
from the Groins, and grown inordinately
large and hard from the same Cause
that enlarges any other neighbouring
Parts that exceed their natural Size.</p>

<p>To the first of these Mr <i>Cheselden</i>,
and, I am told, some others in Town,
seem to assent.</p>

<p>The second is the Opinion of Dr <i>Douglas</i>,
for which see his Explanation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span></p>

<p>And the last is the Conjecture of Sir
<i>Hans Sloane</i>. However, as none of these
Opinions can be ascertained without a
fair Dissection of such a Subject, as this
is, in all Respects, and that by the best
Anatomists; and tho’ many Queries and
Arguments might be exhibited both for
and against these Notions, we chuse rather
to omit controverting any one Point,
as to this Particular, for the present, and
refer the Matter to the first Experiment
that shall happen upon such an Occasion.</p>

<i>The CONCLUSION.</i></h2>

<p><i>Containing a Description of a Fœtus,
and a Recital of the Dissections
of such Subjects by some
other Authors.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The Examination of any more
Authors upon this Topick would
amount to more Pains than at present
are necessary, and besides, Repetitions
could hardly be avoided if any more were
called in Question, since we find Authors
were so fond of running in the
same Path with one another; therefore
the Remarks that have been made on
those already mentioned may, I hope,
be sufficient (together with the rest that
has been said) to answer the End of this
Treatise, which is no more than to illustrate
the Cause of the first Rise of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
Notions of Hermaphrodites among Men;
to shew how credulous our Ancestors
have been of these Chimera’s, and how
fond of encouraging their Progress tho’
in the meanest Manner of arguing; to
prove, by comparing all the Opinions of
Authors, that no hermaphrodital Nature
can exist in human Bodies; and, in fine,
that those Subjects hitherto so accounted,
were only Females in all Respects,
superstitiously, and through Ignorance,
mistaken for those Kind of Creatures, or
for Men; which, with some other Disorders
of the Pudenda of either Sex, gave
rise to the several Divisions that afterwards
sprung up concerning them; as far
from Truth (or even rational Conjecture)
as any other Error that ever was received
by Mankind. And this will still be further
illustrated by the following Description
of a Fœtus, with a very large Clitoris,
that came to my Hands some time
since, which I have taken due Care of
for this Purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p>This Subject was an abortive Fœtus
of about six Months Growth, in which
(though so young) the Pudenda are conspicuous
enough, and the Clitoris sufficiently
large to prove every Thing that
has been said upon the Subject; and to
serve as a Standard, wherewith to confront
any fabulous Reports that may
hereafter spring up in the World, which
I have endeavoured to describe in the
most faithful Manner that I am capable
of.</p>

<p>But before we proceed to this Description,
it will be of great Use towards the
Design of this little Work, to insert the
following Observation; which I had the
Honour to lay before the <i>Royal Society</i>
on <i>Thursday</i> the 30th of <i>April</i> 1741, and
which, I hope, will add no small Force
to what has been already said upon it.</p>

<p>All female Fœtus’s, during the greatest
Part of the Time of Gestation, have
the Clitoris as large in Proportion to their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
Sizes, and sometimes larger, than the <i>Angolan</i>
Woman before-mentioned, which is
evident from several then shewed together
to the Society; this, I am inclined to believe,
is Nature’s common Rule all over
the World. Now it is impossible that
so many Hermaphrodites should be found
at once, since we have so very few Instances
among the <i>European</i> Nations of
those so reputed; though, as is before
observed, they are common enough in
<i>Africa</i> and <i>Asia</i>, in all those Places
especially that are nearest the Equinoctial
Line; where the Nonnaturals
themselves conduce much to the
general Relaxation of the Solids, and
consequently, this unseemly Accretion of
that Part.</p>

<p>Now as the Fœtus increases in a natural
Way, the neighbouring Parts of
the Pudenda grow more in Proportion
than the Clitoris, drawing away the Integuments,
whereby it becomes by Degrees
less conspicuous; but when it continues
it’s Growth, together with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
rest, maintaining it’s first proportional
Size, the Person is reported to be an
Hermaphrodite; the natural Structure of
this Part being in a great Measure like
that of a Penis virilis.</p>

<p>Nor is it’s Largeness in a Fœtus much
to be wondered at, since there are other
very similar Cases in the same Body, as
the Gland <i>Thymus</i> and <i>Glandulæ Renales</i>;
nor is it, indeed, any more wonder
to find it’s Growth increased, when once
continued till a little after Birth; because
Erections of that Part begin very early
in Children, which, protruding the Integuments,
increase their Relaxation, and
thereby remove all Obstacles to it’s Luxuriancy.</p>

<p>First then in viewing the Parts from
above downwards, the Clitoris appears
very large in Proportion to the Size of
the Subject, and juts out in the Place
which is always the Seat of that Part,
according to Nature. It is circumscribed
round the Root chiefly, on the upper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
Side, by a Ridge of the common Cutis,
which reaches from one Side, continued
with the Labium to the other.</p>

<p>The Præputium, indeed, is not to be
well distinguished, because of the Minuteness
of the Fœtus; however it shews
very plainly, that a Continuation of the
common Skin of the Clitoris is lapped
round the Substance of this Part,
and meeting at the very Extremity on
the under Side, forms an Angle, from
which the Nymphæ arise in an equal
Point, and are inserted also on the Sides
of the Orificium Vaginæ, being very
large and conspicuous.</p>

<p>What appears to be a Rima or Slit in
the Extremity of the Clitoris, in the Opinions
of many, is no other than the
Angle made by the Plication of the two
Nymphæ where they arise, which undoubtedly
is always the natural Case, and
no other, in every Subject of this Nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span></p>

<p>The Labia are like those of any other
female Child, continuing from the Ridge
round the Clitoris, and terminating regularly
in the <i>Perinæum</i>, being somewhat
more protuberant at their middle
than at either their Origination or Insertion.</p>

<p>The Vagina is in a natural State, and
as for the Meatus Urinarius, it is too
minute in this Fœtus to have any Observation
made of it. This is all that is
necessary to be said of it by way of Description;
but I have subjoined the two
following Figures of the Parts of Generation
of this <i>Fœtus</i>, in order to make the
Observation on them still more obvious
and plain, which I have done something
larger than the Life, in due Proportion,
because a Drawing of the same Size
with the Subject would be too small for
Explanation; but have, at the same time,
taken the utmost care not to digress from
the Truth in the least, in order to favour
any particular Fancy whatsoever.</p>

<p>But having understood that some were
particularly of Opinion, that such as have
the Clitoris long have no <i>Uteri</i>, I opened<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
the above-mentioned Fœtus, and found
the Uterus in it’s natural Situation, with
every Appendix proper to it, in their
Places; which, with the Dissections made
by several Anatomists upon such Occasions,
will be very prevailing, to manifest
the Existence of an Uterus in every
<i>Macroclitoridea</i>, whether any Thing be
contained in the Labia or not.</p>

<p>1. <i>De Graaff</i>’s Dissection, mentioned
before, is no insignificant Proof of this
Assertion.</p>

<p>2. Another made, and related by <i>Columbus</i>,
will be also as corroborating, of
one whom he calls a Woman (and, indeed,
without any Mistake) he introduces
the Description of her in these
Words<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span></p>

<p>‘Formerly I happened to see a Woman,
who, besides the Vulva, had also
a Penis, which was not very thick.’</p>

<p>This Membrum virile is (beyond all
Dispute) the Clitoris, because he says
<i>præter vulvam</i>; and, I hope, from what
has been said before, it is plain, that no
Male Parts can possibly grow with the
Feminine in the same Body; however,
this Author proceeds to describe the Blood
Vessels, <i>&amp;c.</i> to which I refer the Reader,
and shall only pass on to observe
what is to my Purpose here, which is
contained in his following Words<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span></p>

<p>‘The Uterus and Cervix did not in
the least differ from those of other Women,
but there was a Difference in the
Testes, for in this Subject they were
thicker than in others, but their Situation
was the same. There was no
Scrotum at all, and the Penis had two
Muscles, not four, as in perfect Men;
besides, the Penis of this Hermaphrodite
was covered with a thin Skin, but
had no Præputium, <i>&amp;c.</i>’</p>

<p>From which Words it is obvious,
what was the Sex of this Subject, without
any further Observations on it.</p>

<p>As Dr <i>Douglas</i>’s Plate only shews the

the <i>Labia</i> shut or closed; that the Reader

<p>‘Androgynorum in Jure Hebraico frequens mentio
est, etsi de causis confusæ in ipsis naturæ non admodum
sunt solliciti. Nam simplicissime scribunt Androgynum
(hæc vox ipsis familiaris est) esse, in quo
utriusque sexus membra genitalia sint, quorum unum
tamen altero sit luxuriosius &amp; potentius: hinc de jure
eorum magis disputant, quod ex corpore juris ipsorum,
sive Talmud, transtulimus, verba ergo hæc habentur.</p>

<p>‘Androgynus sua natura partim similis est viris, partim
mulieribus: partim viris &amp; mulieribus, partim
denique est propria persona, neque viris neque mulieribus
similis.</p>

<p>‘I. Viris similis est, quinque modis juxta legem librorum
Mosis: 1. Polluendo omnem hominem, omnemque
rem, quam tangit, aut quæ ipsum tangit in
illo tempore quo semen emittit, quemadmodum &amp;
viri modis omnibus polluunt secundum legem Mosis:
2. Quod tenentur in uxorem ducere fratris sui viduam
relictam, quæ prolem ab ipso non habuit, uti ut viri
secundum legem Mosis obstricti sunt: 3. Quod tenentur
incedere vestitu à capite ad calcem more virorum,
&amp; pilos abradere more virorum, non mulierum, luxus
gratia: 4. Quod illis permissum est mulierem in uxorem
ducere, uti &amp; aliis viris, &amp; non nubere viro:
5. Quod tenentur observare præcepta omnia juxta legem
Mosis, sicuti omnes viri Judæi observare tenentur:
non autem sicuti mulieres, quæ non tenentur
omnia Mosis præcepta observare, secundum ea quæ
tempora requirunt.</p>

<p>II. ‘Mulieribus autem similis reperitur septem modis
secundum legem Mosis: 1. Similis est mulieribus
polluendo omnem hominem, aliasque res, quas tangit,
aut quæ ipsam tangunt, tempore menstrui, uti &amp;
menstruæ mulieres sanguinis fluxu laborant, &amp; tunc
polluit per omnia sicuti sexus mulieris secundum Mosis
legem: 2. Quod illi non licet cum viro solus in gynæceo
versari, aut in locis privatis: sicut ut mulieri secundum
legem Mosis prohibitum est: 3. Quod illi
concessum, in circuitu attondere angulum capitis sui
more mulierum. Quia etiam illi permissum dissipare
angulum barbæ suæ, quod tamen viris interdictum secundum
legem Mosis: 4. Quod ei licitum est se cadaveribus
polluere, &amp; inter mortuos sepultos ambulare,
uti &amp; mulier, quod tamen viris inhibitum est secundum
Mosis legem: 5. Quod ad testimonium exhibendum
non est idoneus, sicut &amp; sexus muliebris non
idoneus existit, juxta legem Mosis: 6. Quod illi est
prohibitus omnis illegitimus &amp; illicitus concubitus ut
&amp; aliis mulieribus: 7. Quod vitiatur illicito concubitu,
apud sacerdotes, (id est sacerdoti si nubat) qui sunt de
semine Aaronis, ut &amp; mulier vitiatur secundum legem
Mosis.</p>

<p>III. ‘Comparatur autem mulieribus &amp; viris sex modis:
1. Percussus ab aliquo, cum illo transigere debet
de damno ad summum æstimando a viris &amp; mulieribus
secundum legem Mosis: 2. Si contigeret ut aliquis
illum imprudenter interimeret, occisorem recipere
se opportet in unam civitatum securitatis causa ordinatarum,
inque ea ad summi Pontificis obitum manere,
non secus ac si virum aut mulierem imprudenter interfecisset,
secundum legem Mosis.</p>

<p>‘Si vero ipsum malitiosè aut voluntariè interfecit,
etiam ipse occisor mori debet, non secus atque si virum
mulieremve interfecisset: 3. Mater pariens Androgynum
in puerperio septem diebus immunda haberi debet,
propter sexum virilem; rursus verò per alios septem
dies pro immunda censeri debet propter sexum fæmineum:
quindecem dies immunda censeri debet postquam
peperit secundum leges Mosis (id est, numerare
debet dies pollutionis ac purificationis, tanquam si filium
&amp; filiam genuisset): 4. Androgynus, si ex genere
sacerdotali, etiam particeps fit sacrificiorum more
aliorum virorum qui sunt ex sacerdotali genere, secundum
Mosis legem: 5. Partem habet paternæ atque
maternæ hæreditatis: in aliis quinetiam hæreditatibus
jure ad illum spectantibus suam partem habet ac vir
ac mulier, prout illi omnium optimè cedi potest.
6. Si quis dixerit, cupio ab omnibus rebus mundanis
separari, tunc si Androgynus fuerit, in una parte tam
masculini quam fæminini generis, debet hoc testari sufficienter,
&amp; separatus esse, secundum Mosis legem (id
est Naziræatus voto tenetur).</p>

<p>IV. ‘Similis denique neque viris neque mulieribus,
sed propria persona existit tribus modis (sive nutrius
sexus jus habet): 1. Licet Androgynus aliquem
percutiat, vel calumnietur alium, tamen non tenetur
satisfacere, secundum legem de viris &amp; mulieribus:
sed tanquam singularis persona est, debetque satisfacere
secundum Judicium sententiam, aut quomodocunque
transigere potest: 2. Si Androgynus votum nuncupaverit,
secundum æstimationem personæ suæ Domino,
&amp; æstimationem de pretio personæ suæ Dei templo
dedicaverit, si non æstimatus fuerit secundum expressam
Mosis legem, sicuti viri &amp; mulieres, tantum
ut singularis persona secundum Judicium sacerdotis æstimetur,
aut quomodocunque transigere potest cum
iis qui Dei templo præsunt: 3. Si quis diceret cupio
esse nuncupatus Deo, separatus ab omnibus rebus mundanis
(sive obstringens se Naziræatus voto) tum si persona
illa neque vir, neque mulier, verba ipsius pro
nihilo habenda, neque Deo nuncupari debet: hæc ex
Judæorum Talmud.</p>

<p>‘Rabbi Meir dixit: Androgynus est creatura per se
ipsa ac specialis, neque voluerunt sapientes definire ac
statuere, an vir, an mulier judicari deberet. Sed Obthurati
alia ratio est: is enim quandoque vir, quandoque
mulier est, prout natura in ipso nunc hoc, nunc
illud membrum patefacit.’</p>

suscipit caracterem (<i>sum.</i> Sylvest. <i>par. 1. tit.

sed si magis vergit in sexum fæmininum quam masculinum,
vel etiam si æqualiter participat de utroque,
non est susceptivus caracteris, secundum Guil. multo
magis fæmina, ordinis non est susceptiva quia non potest
dici aliquis, vel aliqua. Idem sentit Astexanus <i>in
sum. de casib. lib. 6. de sacram. ord. tit. 26.</i> &amp; addit
si magis vergat in sexum virilem, quam muliebrem,

Quod sic, sive judicetur tanquam fæminina, sive tanquam

<p>‘At Sichardus <i>in suis prælection. in rod. tit. 53. l. 8.

<p>XVI. ‘Quæritur, qualiter debeat servire Hermaphrodita?

Apparere duas conclusiones, sive opiniones in Hermaphrodita:
una quod sufficiat servire taliter, qualiter
potest, &amp; non debeat servire per substitutum, ex quo

Hinc certum est, quod debeat decedere sive Hærede

vocantur agnati in originali investitur, &amp; ejus reliquiis

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
